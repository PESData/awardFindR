        Project Summary\\nThis is a proposal for a fourth renewal of travel grant
        R13AA017107. For the last nine years, this grant has\\nprovided funding to
        support scientific dissemination and early career investigator (ECI) career
        development at\\nthe annual convention of the American Psychological Association
        (APA). Psychologists make up a major\\nconstituency in the scientific community
        of alcohol researchers and on topics related to alcohol. The APA is\\nthe
        largest organization of psychologists and their trainees in the US, and its
        annual convention attracts\\nthousands of attendees. In particular, APA Division
        50 (Society for Addiction Psychology) and Division 28\\n(Psychopharmacology
        and Substance Abuse) are heavily populated with alcohol researchers, with
        further\\nalcohol researchers in Divisions 38 (Health Psychology) and 5 (Quantitative
        and Qualitative Methods), many of\\nwhom are recipients of NIAAA funding.
        This R13 grant represents a collaboration between Division 50\\n(primary)
        and Divisions 28, 38, and 5 (partnering divisions) to achieve two goals: (1)
        to disseminate the state-\\nof-the-art alcohol research to the psychological
        community; (2) to foster the development of the next\\ngeneration of alcohol
        researchers from the psychological community. The first goal will be achieved
        by\\nsupporting state-of-the-art alcohol research within the Division 50,
        28, 38 and 5 conference programs. This will\\ntake the form of travel support
        for speakers in two symposia that showcase advances and innovations in\\nalcohol
        research. In addition, these symposia and other alcohol research will be communicated
        to conference\\nattendees via an \\\"Alcohol Research Highlights\\\" brochure.
        The second goal will be achieved by providing 20\\ntravel awards to ECIs (i.e.,
        graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty) and hosting an
        ECI\\nposter session/social hour. In addition, the R13 will support a career
        development symposium each year. For\\nboth, the dissemination goal and the
        career development goal, the R13 will reach out to women and\\nunderrepresented
        minorities to maximize inclusion. To date, this R13 grant has been highly
        successful in\\ndisseminating advances in alcohol research and nurturing the
        careers of early career alcohol researchers. The\\ngoal for the next segment
        is to sustain these contributions to the field.\",\"project_title\":\"Enhancing

        smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, causing
        approximately\\n480,000 smoking-related deaths per year. The Food and Drug
        Administration (FDA) has the regulatory\\nauthority to enact tobacco product
        standards if such product changes would more likely than not have a\\npositive
        public health impact. In 2009, the FDA banned flavored cigarettes from being
        sold but allowed menthol\\ncigarettes to remain on the market. Nearly one-third
        of the cigarettes sold in the U.S. have menthol as a\\ncharacterizing flavor,
        and these cigarettes are associated with low quit rates in vulnerable populations.
        Survey\\ndata suggest that large proportions of menthol cigarette smokers
        would quit if menthol cigarettes were no\\nlonger available. Therefore, tobacco
        control policies aimed at limiting access to menthol cigarettes may have\\nmajor
        public health benefits. However, if menthol cigarettes were no longer available,
        smokers may switch to\\nflavored little cigars or cigarillos (LCCs) due to
        their similarities to cigarettes. From a harm reduction\\nperspective, switching
        to LCCs rather than quitting smoking or using non-combustible tobacco products
        will not\\nimprove individual or population-level health outcomes. Thus, tobacco
        control policies focusing on menthol\\ncigarettes may need to apply broadly
        to all combustible tobacco products. Behavioral economics is an ideal\\nframework
        for addressing this research question because it applies economic constructs
        such as response\\ncost, product substitution, and demand elasticity to understand
        product consumption and decision-making. We\\nare proposing a within-subjects
        laboratory study and followed by validation field assessments to understand\\nhow
        restricting access to menthol cigarettes would affect alternative tobacco
        product selection and use. We will\\nenroll 40 menthol smokers who will complete
        four lab sessions and two field assessments. During two of the\\nlab sessions,
        participants will complete a behavioral economics assessment, the Experimental
        Tobacco\\nMarketplace task, designed to simulate how restricting access to
        menthol cigarettes would affect the purchase\\nof alternative products, which
        will include menthol LCCs in one session but not include menthol LCCs available\\nin
        another session. After these lab sessions, participants will be provided with
        the tobacco products they\\npurchased to use during a 3-day field assessment
        to validate the task. At the final lab session, a qualitative\\ninterview
        with these participants will be conducted to learn more about their experiences
        selecting and using\\ntobacco products other than menthol cigarettes. Data
        from this trial will inform public health officials and policy-\\nmakers about

        SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT\\nHeart replacement therapies (i.e., heart transplants and
        left ventricular assist devices) can improve advanced\\nheart failure patients’
        morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. However, these therapies are associated
        with both\\nhigh risks and potentially high rewards. An advanced heart failure
        patient’s path to receiving heart replacement\\ntherapies is dependent on
        3 critical steps: (1) referral to an advanced heart failure center, (2) clinical
        evaluation\\nat the center, and (3) case review by a multidisciplinary selection
        committee. This pathway is heterogeneous\\nacross the country leading to both
        underuse and overuse of therapies. There is an urgent need to study where\\nand
        why these variations in use exist and to implement solutions that reduce unwarranted
        variations in care.\\nThe rationale that underlies the proposed research is
        that if we can understand the factors that lead to\\nvariations in heart replacement
        therapies at each of the three critical steps, we can develop standardized\\nprocesses
        to ensure that heart failure patients who are most likely to benefit from
        these therapies have access\\nto them, and those who are unlikely to qualify
        can move quickly to other treatment approaches most suited to\\ntheir needs
        and preferences. This career development award includes three complementary
        aims. Aim 1 will\\nquantitatively assess the degree of geographic variation
        at each of the three steps using Medicare claims and\\nthe Dartmouth Atlas
        hospital referral regions. Aim 2 will qualitatively assess reasons for variation
        by performing\\ncritical reviews of selection meetings and stakeholder interviews
        at advanced heart failure centers that are\\nchosen based on findings from
        Aim 1. Aim 3 will use Delphi panels to rank factors contributing to unwarranted\\nvariation
        and propose potential solutions to reduce variation. A deeper understanding
        of variations in heart\\nreplacement therapy use coupled with expert-vetted
        proposed solutions for the leading problems will result in a\\nR01 intervention
        trial that will address one or more of the modifiable factors and will help
        reduce unwarranted\\nvariations in use of heart replacement therapies. The
        applicant, an advanced heart failure cardiologist,\\nproposes a five-year
        career development program to complement the research proposal. This incorporates\\nclose
        mentoring with Drs. Larry Allen (primary), Dan Matlock, and Fred Masoudi,
        nationally-renowned\\ncardiovascular outcomes researchers with expertise in
        advanced heart failure, claims data, qualitative\\nresearch, and shared decision-making.
        The candidate has built productive relationships with her mentors with\\nfour
        published manuscripts and two in progress and has a supportive institutional
        environment. To supplement\\nher prior Masters in Public Health training,
        the candidate has developed a detailed didactic plan that includes\\ntraining
        in Medicare claims data use, geographic analyses, qualitative methodology,
        and dissemination and\\nimplementation science. The candidate’s long-term
        goal is to improve equitable, judicious, patient-centered\\nuse of heart replacement
        therapies for patients with advanced heart failure. The proposed research,
        which\\nserves as a key first step towards the applicant reaching her long-term
        goal, is significant because it will fill the\\nexisting gaps in knowledge
        to help reduce variations in use of heart replacement therapies.\",\"project_title\":\"Variations

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the U.S., nearly 500,000 patients
        suffer an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) each year. Most emergency
        departments (EDs) lack the local capabilities to perform primary percutaneous
        coronary intervention (PCI) for myocardial reperfusion. Thus, patients must
        be transferred to capable facilities, but inefficiencies in this process cause
        delays in timely myocardial reperfusion and worsen patient outcomes. The time
        to reperfusion for transferred STEMI patients greatly lags behind those patients
        who present directly to PCI centers and fails to meet national benchmark standards
        in 90% of cases. Inadequate measurement and understanding of the timing and
        processes of care at transferring EDs has hindered improvement in the timeliness
        of STEMI patient transfer. Moreover, the study of relational coordination,
        communication, and organizational design, collectively known as \\\"organizational
        behavior,\\\" is an accepted approach to study performance and variation in
        complex health systems. It has not yet been applied to the transfer of STEMI
        patients, but would likely reveal important targets for intervention. This
        proposal describes a career development plan that enables the candidate to
        gain expertise in how organizational behavior affects patient care, through
        the acquisition of advanced qualitative and quantitative skills for future
        implementation studies. The Specific Aims are: 1) Examine transferring ED
        data for factors associated with delays to myocardial reperfusion; 2) Conduct
        a detailed qualitative study of the practices that affect patient transfer
        for primary PCI; and 3) Examine the association between relational coordination
        and time spent at transferring EDs. The candidate is uniquely qualified as
        an emergency physician and PhD candidate in operations management. The career
        development plan builds on this foundation to provide: a) advanced skills
        in qualitative methods (e.g., patient and staff interviewing skills, and observation),
        biostatistics, and organizational theory; b) further development of scientific
        communication skills through manuscript preparation, grant writing, and conference
        presentations; and c) a multidisciplinary mentored research experience with
        international experts in transitions of care, qualitative research, process
        intervention development, and trial design. The institutional environment
        is outstanding, including a qualitative research center; nationally ranked
        graduate programs in the candidate's fields of study; and the national CTSA
        coordinating center. This career development award will allow the candidate
        to develop expertise in measuring the performance of healthcare systems during
        inter-facility patient transfer, a deep understanding of the relationship
        between system performance and patient outcomes, and targets for intervention
        to improve the timeliness of patient care for myocardial infarction. This
        award will position the candidate to become an R01-funded independent investigator
        who implements and evaluates process interventions to improve patient outcomes.\",\"project_title\":\"Enhancing

        the HIV/AIDS treatment cascade model, people living with HIV (PLHIV) who are
        engaged in care are more\\nlikely to adhere to HIV Anti-Retroviral Therapy
        (ART) and achieve durable viral suppression. In order to achieve\\nviral suppression,
        near perfect adherence to ART is required. Even though PLHIV are responsible
        for medication\\nadherence, in HIV treatment guidelines, HIV care providers
        play an important role in encouraging and monitoring\\nART adherence. After

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The burden of HIV is ~60% higher
        in women than men in sub-Saharan Africa, and this gender inequity is a key
        challenge to HIV control. Identifying women at greatest risk for HIV and their
        infecting male partners is critical for effective, targeted control of the
        African HIV epidemic. It is also vital to identify those HIV-infected women
        most likely to contribute to ongoing viral spread. However, African women
        vastly underreport sexual contacts and high risk occupations such as sex work
        in interview-based surveys and clinical settings making their identification
        challenging. Here, we propose to use phylogenetic, epidemiological, and qualitative
        methods to study network drivers of female risk of HIV acquisition and onward
        transmission to men in the rural Rakai District, Uganda. We will use existing
        data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), a population- based study
        of HIV incidence and behaviors in 50 communities (n~17,000). In Aim 1 we will
        identify HIV- infected women who have central roles in transmission networks
        using viral phylogenetics and then characterize them with RCCS epidemiological
        data. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with these women to gain deeper
        insight into their HIV-related risks and to understand the barriers to reporting
        these risks. In Aim 2 we will use viral phylogenetics in conjunction with
        probabilistic statistical models to identify the pool of infecting male partners
        tat sustain the excess HIV burden among Rakai women. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will
        use microsimulation models to estimate the potential effectiveness of various
        combination HIV prevention strategies targeted to high risk subgroups to reduce
        HIV incidence. The proposed research is part of a K01 award and will provide
        the applicant with the advanced training in HIV modelling, behavioral science,
        and phylogenetics necessary to transition to an independent investigator with
        expertise in the application of interdisciplinary methods to HIV epidemiology
        and prevention. Results will improve female HIV risk assessment and identify
        candidate targeted strategies to prevent HIV in African women. It also will
        provide critical formative data fr a future R01 to implement and empirically
        assess the effectiveness of targeted interventions to high risk women and

        SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\\nThe primary objective of this K23 research project is to
        prepare Jennifer K. Walter, MD, PhD, MS for her long-\\nterm goal of becoming
        an independent physician-investigator testing interventions in the field of
        cardiac\\ndisease and pediatric palliative care. Her immediate goal is to
        obtain the training, mentorship, and research\\nexperience necessary to successfully
        compete for R01 grants supporting intervention studies in this area. To\\nmeet
        this goal, Dr. Walter and her mentors have developed a comprehensive career
        development plan that\\nincludes: 1) advanced training in modification of
        clinician and team behavior, simulation-based team training,\\nrigorous quantitative
        and qualitative methods, and study trial design to evaluate bio-behavioral
        interventions; 2)\\nintensive mentorship from a team with whom Dr. Walter
        has a track record of collaboration and scholarship,\\nincluding Chris Feudtner,
        MD PhD MPH (primary mentor), Vinay Nadkarni, MD (secondary mentor), Martha\\nCurley
        PhD RN FAAN, and Robert Arnold, MD (advisory committee members); 3) protected
        research time in\\nan institution that has successfully supported numerous
        junior investigators; and 4) an innovative research plan\\nto develop and
        test an intervention with both CICU parents and teams that aims to optimize
        communication in\\nfamily meetings to better achieve patient, parent and team
        outcomes. Pediatric advanced heart disease is a\\nleading cause of non-accidental
        death for children. The children that die do so in the cardiac intensive care
        unit\\n(CICU), where many parents report being unprepared for the death and
        as a result, are unable to make goal-\\nconcordant decisions. Thus, there
        is a critical need to create evidence-based interventions that support\\nteams
        and families in effectively communicating about treatment goals. To achieve
        this objective, Dr.\\nWalter will identify a cohort of parents of patients
        with advanced heart disease and clinicians regularly\\nattending interprofessional
        team meetings in the CICU who will participate in family meetings. With this
        cohort,\\nDr. Walter will: 1) Use co-design methods working with parents of
        CICU patients and interprofessional team\\nmembers to custom adapt an intervention
        called CICU Teams and Loved Ones Communicating (CICU TALC)\\nto improve CICU
        family meetings; 2) Assess the acceptability and feasibility of CICU TALC
        on parent, patient,\\nand team outcomes with 20 clinicians and 46 parents
        of CICU children; and 3) Test the impact of CICU TALC\\non team and parent
        behavior in family meetings. The findings will provide evidence to justify
        a pragmatic step-\\nwedge methodological approach for a fully powered trial
        of CICU TALC. The research and career development\\nactivities outlined above
        will take place in the collaborative academic environment of the The Children's\\nHospital
        of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine
        with the support of a\\nteam of nationally recognized mentors and advisors
        who will ensure Dr. Walter's success.\",\"project_title\":\"Improving Family

        health care – the splitting of a patient's care across multiple providers

        these outcomes is a VA priority, and an increasing challenge as Veterans receive
        more care from non-\\nVA providers. Coordination is the organization of patient
        care between two or more participants to ensure\\nappropriate delivery of
        healthcare services. For specialty care referrals, which number >25 million

        to understand the key factors to success of 4 selected\\nmechanisms. Data
        analysis will use a mixed deductive-inductive approach and be guided by the
        Consolidated\\nFramework for Implementation Research. Aim 3 will build on

        SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT\\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause
        of cancer death in the US. Despite overwhelming\\nevidence that screening
        reduces both CRC incidence and mortality, less than two-thirds of eligible
        adults are\\nup-to-date with screening. These figures also overestimate the
        proportion of Americans who receive adequate\\nlong-term protection from CRC
        because they are based on one-time, cross-sectional measurements. To\\nensure
        that eligible populations receive maximal benefit from CRC screening, it is
        critical to accurately\\nmeasure adherence to different screening strategies
        over multiple cycles, to identify the various barriers to\\nrepeated screening,
        and to translate this information into effective interventions that can be
        implemented\\nrapidly and efficiently. This K08 proposal will address the
        following three specific aims: (1) Quantify longitudinal\\nadherence to screening
        colonoscopy and FOBT/FIT in the national VA database over a 15-year period;
        (2)\\nIdentify social and contextual barriers and facilitators to longitudinal
        adherence using a qualitative approach in\\nveterans who are due for repeat
        screening/surveillance colonoscopy at an urban VA hospital; and (3) Assess\\nthe
        feasibility of a pilot bidirectional text messaging intervention on attendance
        for screening/surveillance\\ncolonoscopy and bowel preparation quality. This
        will be the first study to compare longitudinal adherence to\\nscreening colonoscopy
        and FOBT/FIT and one of the first to investigate the influence of text messaging
        on\\ncolonoscopy adherence. This award will allow the PI to obtain additional
        training in quantitative and qualitative\\nmethods, behavioral intervention
        design, and mHealth. Findings from the proposal will provide important\\ninsight
        into the optimal long-term CRC screening strategy and methods to improve adherence
        to repeat\\nscreening. This will form the foundation of a subsequent R01 grant

        Summary:\\nFailure to deliver care near the end of life that reflects the
        needs, values and preferences of patients with\\nadvanced cancer remains a
        key shortcoming of our cancer care delivery system. National organizations\\nincluding
        the National Academy of Medicine and American Society of Clinical Oncology
        have called for\\nincreased attention to advance care planning (ACP) to improve
        patient-centered care near end of life. A critical\\nbarrier to progress in
        the field is a lack of evidence about the most effective and efficient ACP
        strategy to\\nimprove treatment decisions near end of life and ensure patients'
        wishes are honored.\\nTwo different patient-facing ACP interventions are widely
        used and known to be effective but entail sizeable\\ndifferences in costs
        and complexity to deploy: (1) in-person discussions with trained facilitators
        and (2) web-\\nbased advance care planning using interactive videos. These
        approaches have never been compared directly; it\\nis therefore unclear whether
        one form of ACP is more potent—and if so, for whom and under what\\ncircumstances.
        Understanding the relative effectiveness of in-person, facilitated versus
        web-based ACP is\\nimportant because in-person ACP requires far more resources.\\nThis
        proposal is a single-blind, patient-level randomized trial to address this
        evidence gap, using mixed\\nmethods to compare the effectiveness of in-person,
        facilitated ACP vs web-based ACP among 400 patients with\\nadvanced cancer
        and their family caregivers. Aim 1 compares the effect of these approaches
        on patient and\\nfamily caregiver outcomes (engagement in ACP—primary outcome;
        ACP discussions with family caregivers and\\nphysicians; advance directive
        (AD) completion; and caregiver symptoms of depression and anxiety). For\\npatients
        who die during the study period, we will use validated, caregiver-reported
        measures to compare\\nperceived quality of EOL care, patients' EOL goal attainment,
        and bereaved caregiver symptoms of depression,\\nanxiety and post-traumatic
        stress. Aim 2 assesses implementation costs of each intervention and effects
        on\\nhealthcare utilization at end of life. Aim 3 identifies contexts and
        mechanisms influencing the effectiveness of\\neach approach.\\nThis trial
        will have a high impact because it will provide new and much-needed empirical
        evidence about two\\npatient-facing ACP approaches that successfully overcome
        limitations of traditional written advance directives\\nbut entail very different
        investments of time and resources. It is innovative in using mixed methods
        to\\nevaluate not only the comparative effectiveness of these approaches,
        but also for whom, how and in what\\ncircumstances they are effective. It
        is feasible because it builds on extensive infrastructure developed by an\\naccomplished

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  In high burden countries, many
        patients with tuberculosis (TB) who present to community health centers are
        lost to follow-up before TB can be diagnosed or treated, leading to ongoing
        transmission. A primary reason is that the standard approach of collecting
        sputum specimens over multiple days for microscopic examination is not only
        insensitive but also inconvenient and costly for patients. Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert)
        is a semi-automated molecular test that identifies 90% of TB cases within
        2 hours. Xpert is now recommended as the initial diagnostic test for pulmonary
        TB but cannot be deployed at community health centers because of cost and
        infrastructure requirements. To achieve access, utilization and impact on
        health outcomes, strategies for successful referrals from community health
        centers to facilities in which Xpert is being deployed are essential. Our
        overall objective s to assess the effectiveness, implementation and impact
        of a streamlined, single- sample (SIMPLE) TB diagnostic evaluation strategy.
        The SIMPLE TB strategy was developed after a theory-informed assessment of
        provider- and patient-level barriers to TB diagnostic evaluation and through
        a process of stakeholder engagement. Its components include: 1) Single-sample
        LED fluorescence microscopy (analysis and reporting of smear results from
        the initial specimen within two hours); 2) Daily transport of smear-negative
        sputum samples to Xpert testing sites; 3) SMS-based reporting of Xpert test
        results to patients and health centers; and 4) Routine feedback of TB evaluation
        metrics to health center staff. Our central hypothesis is that the SIMPLE
        TB strategy will increase the number of patients with active TB for whom treatment
        is initiated. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a cluster-randomized
        trial at 20 community health centers in Uganda to determine whether the SIMPLE
        TB strategy improves TB diagnosis and treatment initiation rates relative
        to the prevailing standard-of-care (Aim 1). Routine data collected on adults
        undergoing TB diagnostic evaluation at intervention and control health centers
        will be used to assess trial outcomes. Concurrently with the clinical trial,
        we will employ\\na mixed methods approach to evaluate in detail the process
        of implementation (Aim 2), focusing on factors that influence the adoption
        and maintenance of intervention components and faithfulness to our conceptual
        model. Last, we will perform economic and epidemic modeling to estimate the
        cost-effectiveness and epidemiological impact (i.e., future TB incidence)
        of the SIMPLE TB strategy (Aim 3). Relying solely on novel diagnostic technologies
        without also supporting health system interventions to facilitate their uptake
        and use is unlikely to result in sustained and meaningful progress in the
        ongoing fight against TB. The comprehensive research plan will generate the
        high-quality evidence needed to guide TB policy makers in deciding whether
        to adopt the SIMPLE TB strategy, and on how best to implement it at other
        health centers. This research will also lead to a better understanding of
        the factors and types of interventions associated with successful implementation
        of novel TB diagnostics in low- income, high TB burden countries.\",\"project_title\":\"SIngle-saMPLE

        SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\\nThis NHLBI K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career
        Development Award (PA-18-374) submission by\\nAnuj B. Mehta, MD will enable
        him to achieve his overarching career goal of improving shared decision-making\\n(SDM)
        in the intensive care unit (ICU) by combining qualitative research methodologies
        with ‘big data’. Dr.\\nMehta is a Pulmonary and Critical Care Physician at
        National Jewish Health. This award will build on Dr.\\nMehta’s prior health
        services research in delivery science and provide him with protected research
        time and\\nsupport to pursue advanced education and training in 1) qualitative
        research 2) advanced statistical\\nmethodologies in health services research,
        3) SDM, and 4) decision aid development. With this proposal, we\\nseek improve
        SDM for tracheostomy by developing and piloting a personalized decision aid
        (AIM 3) with a\\nqualitative decisional needs assessment through semi-structured
        interviews of surrogate decision-makers (AIM\\n1) and development of tailored
        tracheostomy prediction models (AIM 2). The dramatic increases in\\ntracheostomy
        utilization that we have previously reported has large personal and societal
        implications. Patients\\nwho receive a tracheostomy overwhelmingly require
        long-term hospitalization with significant morbidity,\\nmortality, long-term
        care needs, and caregiver stress. Evidence suggests that there is large patient
        and\\nsurrogate frustration with the decision-making process with significant
        decision conflict, misalignment of care\\ndelivered with patient values, and
        discordance between surrogates’ expectations and actual outcomes. These\\nfindings
        raise the possibility that patients may be receiving unwanted, invasive, and
        expensive care not\\nconsistent with their underlying values. SDM is the collaborative
        process of patients, surrogates, and\\nhealthcare providers reaching an informed,
        collective agreement on the treatments consistent with patient’s\\nvalues.
        Decision aids are a key tool with which to facilitate SDM. SDM and decisions
        have been shown to\\nimprove the patient-centeredness of care, improve patient
        knowledge of treatment options and possible\\noutcomes, better align chosen
        treatments with patient values, and reduce decisional regret and conflict.\\nMultiple
        societies now recommend that SDM be a cornerstone of patient centered care
        in the ICU bit its\\npenetration and uptake are limited. We hypothesize that
        a personalized web based decision aid for\\ntracheostomy will improve the
        shared decision making process. Dr. Mehta has strong institutional support
        from\\nNational Jewish Health. Dr. Mehta has assembled a team of mentors well
        suited to ensuring his success\\nduring this Career Development Award led

        recommend a screening urine culture for every\\nVeteran with SCI during their
        annual evaluation, even when symptomatic, which is contrary to other national\\nguidelines.
        Our preliminary data suggest that a positive urine culture (even without signs
        or symptoms of\\ninfection) drives antibiotic use. As the clinical outcomes
        of the annual exam testing have not been explored, we\\ntheorize some Veterans
        are receiving antibiotics unnecessarily. The negative consequences of antibiotic\\noveruse
        and antibiotic resistance are well documented, and have a national and even
        global focus. This study\\nwill develop an intervention aimed to educate stakeholders
        on evidence-based management of ASB and UTI,\\nand guide antibiotic stewardship

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We are grateful for the constructive
        comments and suggestions from the prior review to improve this application.
        The overall objective of this resubmission study (R01NR014846) is to conduct
        a population-level 3-waves longitudinal investigation of 300 adult children
        caregivers in order to quantify the relations between intergenerational solidarity
        and needs for caregivers of Chinese older adults with significant cognitive
        impairment. More specifically, we will conduct three waves of data collection
        and employ mixed effects models to examine three primary objectives: 1) Quantify
        the relations between intergenerational solidarity to the trajectory of caregivers'
        psychological distress; 2) Quantify the relations between intergenerational
        solidarity and caregivers' preparedness; 3) Quantify the relations between
        intergenerational solidarity and caregiver's help seeking behaviors in providing
        care for Chinese older adults with significant cognitive impairment. Our secondary
        objectives are to: 4) examine the gender differences in the above aims 1-3;
        and 5) explore the barriers, challenges, and cultural variations in adult
        children's expectation and adherence of intergenerational solidarity in providing
        care for Chinese older adults with cognitive\\nimpairment.  Despite the rapid
        growth of Chinese populations, there is great paucity in our current understanding
        of caregivers' needs for Chinese older adults with significant cognitive impairment.
        Due to cultural beliefs, many families believe dementia is a form of mental
        illness. The word dementia (¿F) literally translates into two characters:
        \\\"Crazy and Catatonic\\\". The stigma, shame and negative responses experienced
        by patients and families interfere with their willingness to seek appropriate
        medical care. This marked gap in our knowledge is further exacerbated by the
        linguistic and cultural complexities and nuances when studying these issues.
        Moreover, there has been inadequate community support necessary to empower
        the Chinese community to be fully engaged as equal partners in research on
        culturally sensitive issues. Accordingly, we will leverage principles of community-based
        participatory research (CBPR) to quantify the relationship between important
        cultural factors and caregiving needs for Chinese older adults with cognitive
        impairment. In this application, a bilingual and bicultural principal investigator
        and an experienced multi-institutional interdisciplinary team will build on
        our prior NIH funded CBPR projects to collaborate with Chicago Chinese community
        groups. The findings from this proposal will inform clinician, investigator,
        community, social services and\\npolicy makers to: a) identify risk/protective
        factors; b) better understand pathways for addressing\\ncaregiver needs; c)
        inform future prevention and intervention studies; and d) inform the practice
        and policy to improve health and wellbeing in caregiver populations.\",\"project_title\":\"XD

        SUMMARY\\n The objective of this NIDA K08 career development proposal is to
        gain experience and training to\\nbecome an independent investigator focused
        on the development of evidence-based practices to prevent and\\ntreat substance
        use disorders in the emergency department. Opioid use disorders, including
        overdose and\\naddiction, have become epidemic in the United States. While
        research has largely focused on long-term opioid\\nprescribing in the outpatient
        setting, emergency department opioid prescribing for acute painful conditions
        as a\\nportal for future adverse patient outcomes remains poorly defined.\\n
        State governments, including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, have reacted
        to the opioid crisis in\\npart by crafting legislation to broadly limit legal
        opioid prescriptions. However, opioid medications remain an\\nimportant treatment
        option for some acute painful conditions, and evidence based guidance on appropriate\\nprescribing
        is lacking, in part because the factors that impact providers opioid prescribing
        behaviors and\\nsubsequent patient associated adverse outcomes remains unknown.
        Understanding the underlying\\nfactors that influence opioid prescribing behaviors
        and future patient outcomes, including state legislation, peer\\nbehaviors,
        hospital attitudes, and local culture, is a critical step in developing integrated,
        evidence-based\\nrecommendations that focus on transforming the culture surrounding
        safe opioid prescribing practices.\\n Using the theory of planned behavior
        as a framework, the goals of this K08 grant application are to\\nunderstand
        opioid prescribing behaviors and adverse patient outcomes through the following
        aims: First, we\\nwill assess the influence of state legislation, specifically
        the 2016 Massachusetts (MA) Opioid Law, on the\\nformation of hospital-based
        regulations and providers' perceived attitudes towards opioid prescribing
        through\\nqualitative interviews with local physician leaders in MA. Second,
        using comprehensive claims data, we will\\nevaluate the impact of the 2016
        MA Opioid Law on statewide opioid prescribing, using a neighboring state\\nwithout
        opioid legislation as a natural control. Finally, we will examine the association
        of an initial opioid\\nprescription on clinically relevant patient outcomes
        in order to better understand how restricting opioid\\nprescriptions through
        legislation may impact emergency department patients presenting with an acute
        painful\\ncondition.\\n From our results, we will create evidence-based recommendations
        to enhance existing opioid\\nlegislation, as well as develop and execute R01
        funded comprehensive implementation trials that focus not\\nonly on changing
        behaviors of individual providers, but also transforming the group culture
        and social norms\\nthat influence opioid prescribing behaviors.\\n!\",\"project_title\":\"SPOiLER:

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed K99/R00 career development
        award application will support academic preparation and the initiation of
        an independent research career focused on multilevel factors associated with
        oral health using a strengths-based approach to reduce pediatric oral health
        disparities. The oral health of a child cannot be separated from family, community
        and the environment; thus it is vital to include a multilevel perspective
        in any comprehensive model of children's oral health. My research in the K99
        phase will describe the maternal psychosocial and behavioral factors associated
        with ECC and also will describe the prevalence of dental caries in a sample
        of Latino children. Measures taken from the Basic Research Factors Questionnaire
        (BRFQ) will be used to describe psychosocial and behavioral factors (e.g.,
        oral health locus of control, health beliefs, self- efficacy, Sense o Coherence,
        stress, importance of oral health, oral health knowledge and behaviors) in
        Latina mothers of preschool children in Denver, Colorado. The results of this
        study will be compared to that of a high-risk American Indian population in
        which similar measures from the BRFQ were used. During the R00 phase, a mixed
        methods approach will be used to describe the differences at child, family
        and community levels for caries-free and caries-active urban dwelling Latino
        children. This methodology will capture the factors measured by the BRFQ survey
        and then will use qualitative methods to further probe characteristics at
        each level. I will use asset mapping, which is one on the strengths-based
        approaches, to describe the protective health assets that enhance the ability
        of individuals, families, communities and social systems to maintain and sustain
        oral health and to help reduce oral health inequities in high risk and vulnerable

        Summary/Abstract\\n The last decade has seen an explosion of interest in statistical
        modeling and analysis of spatiotemporally\\nmisaligned data and change-of-support
        problems, where different variables of scientiﬁc interest are observed\\nat
        disparate scales making them difﬁcult to be coherently modeled. This is especially
        relevant in environmental\\npublic health, where exposure data may be based
        upon data from monitoring data networks, while climate\\ndata are usually
        available as rasterized outputs from numerical models. The situation is further
        compounded\\nby our objective of associating these factors with health outcomes
        (e.g. disease incidence, hospitalizations,\\nmortality and so on), which are
        reported by public health sources as aggregated data over regions rather than
        at\\npoints. Furthermore, public health researchers today routinely encounter
        datasets exhibiting high-dimensional\\nspatial misalignment or change-of-support,
        where “dimension” refers to one or all of the following: (a) the\\nnumber
        of spatial units (e.g., geographically referenced coordinates), (b) the number
        of temporal units (time\\npoints) at which the variables have been observed,
        and (c) the number of outcomes and other variables being\\nstudied. We propose
        a versatile collection of easily implementable and innovative Bayesian statistical
        methods\\nthat, in conjunction with appropriate software, will offer more
        comprehensive and statistically reliable mapping\\nand analysis for misaligned

        (provided by applicant): This Mentored Scientist Career Development Award
        (K01) application proposes a five-year training plan to provide the Candidate
        with the necessary skills and experience for a future R01 submission and transition
        to independent research. The Candidate, Joseph J. Palamar, PhD, MPH, has shown
        dedication to public health through his research on drug use in New York City
        (NYC) and the stigma associated with recreational drug use. He has authored/coauthored
        24 peer-reviewed manuscripts on the topic he seeks to investigate in this
        proposed project.  The scientific objective of this application is to identify
        se and correlates of use of new and emerging drugs in venues which promote
        highest risk for use (e.g., at nightclubs, dance festivals). This research
        is critical because of the unprecedented rise\\nin new psychoactive drugs,
        not currently assessed by national surveys. It is essential for timely identification
        and documentation of the emergence of new drugs and associated adverse effects
        with short-term informing of policymakers, researchers and educators. Rapid
        survey data is needed to contribute to drug monitoring systems and to triangulate
        secondary data, which generally only focus on adverse outcomes of use (e.g.,
        overdose). The development of a survey tool and documentation of an implementation
        approach will allow epidemiologists to triangulate secondary drug data to
        inform prevention strategies, which address use of these continually emerging
        drugs.  Using a 3-phased mixed-methods approach, Dr. Palamar will develop,
        validate and implement a survey tool to monitor use of new and emerging drugs
        among nightclub/dance festival attendees (age 18-25) as they enter venues
        in NYC. Specifically, he will: 1) carry out formative research to inform survey
        instrument development (N=40 key informant interviews), 2) design and validate
        an initial (longer) survey with online follow-up (N=250), based on the key
        informant interviews, and 3) implement a validated rapid survey (N=500) based
        upon the initial survey reliability and validity results. Through these research
        activities, Dr. Palamar will identiy and characterize use of new and emerging
        drugs among nightclub and dance festival attendees. Specifically, he will
        aim to: 1) identify and describe the current user population and potential
        user population (as per intent to use), 2) identify and describe frequency
        of use, contexts of use, modes of administration, and perceived availability,
        3) examine how use and intention to use relate to use of other drugs and perceived
        contact with users and dealers, and 4) examine socio-demographic and attitudinal
        correlates of use and intention to use, reasons for use, effects from use
        and perceived risk associated with use.  The Candidate has developed a strong
        team of mentors to train him throughout the proposed grant period. His mentors
        and consultants are from diverse backgrounds and experts in drug epidemiology,
        public health, qualitative methods and biostatistics. His Mentor, Dr. Scott
        Sherman, and Co-Mentors, Dr. Danielle Ompad and Dr. Michele Shedlin, will
        be fundamental to the Candidate's development into an independent substance
        abuse researcher. Mentoring will take place in conjunction with coursework
        and participation in seminars and conferences. Throughout this training plan
        the Candidate will: 1) enhance his ability to develop and conduct his own
        independent research study; 2) expand his expertise in drug use epidemiology;
        3) learn time-space and venue-based sampling methodologies; 4) expand his
        knowledge and experience in the design, validation and implementation of surveys,
        which will lead to real-time data, and 5) become more advanced in analysis
        and dissemination of survey data. These goals will foster the Candidate's
        career development and expertise in drug epidemiology and contribute to the
        publication of peer-reviewed manuscripts that will inform prevention science
        and lead to an eventual R01.  The proposed project will take place at the
        New York University School of Medicine, Department of Population Health, which
        has a multidisciplinary research team and integrates ground-breaking research
        with training for the next generation of leaders in public health. The Department
        is committed to training new researchers and promoting development of independent
        investigators. The Candidate will collaborate with epidemiologists at the
        NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and use their secondary data to
        inform and triangulate his survey data. The proposed research plan combined
        with the extensive resources of the institutional environment and the strong
        institutional support for the Candidate's professional development will assure
        successful implementation of this award.  This carefully documented mixed-method
        approach will allow researchers to collect real-time data on new and emerging
        drug trends in nightlife scenes, and quickly inform the scientific community
        and the public about the use, dangers and correlates of new and emerging drugs.
        This information is essential to prevent increasing use and associated adverse
        effects and mortality associated with use of these unstudied drugs. Results
        will also inform prevention strategies, larger-scale studies (e.g., R01s)
        that compare patterns of emergence across US cities, and drug monitoring systems
        (e.g., local, national), enabling them to track use and associated adverse
        consequences of use in a more comprehensive manner.\",\"project_title\":\"Development

        SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\\nHypertension (HTN), which affects nearly 80 million U.S.
        adults and costs society approximately $80 billion\\nannually, is the leading
        modifiable cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Current guidelines recommend
        a\\nstandard systolic blood pressure (SBP) treatment goal of <140 mmHg in
        most patients. The Systolic Blood\\nPressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed
        a 25% reduction in CVD events with intensive SBP treatment\\n(<120 mmHg) in
        high CVD risk adults. However, intensive SBP treatment likely requires additional
        health\\ncare resources and practice changes so it will be challenging to
        implement in real-world settings.\\nThis project proposes to: (1) build and
        validate a “hybrid” hypertension treatment simulation model to\\ndetermine
        the cost-effectiveness of intensive SBP treatment in a population-based sample
        of SPRINT-eligible\\nU.S. adults, (2) incorporate local data from diverse
        health systems into the hybrid blood pressure model to\\ncompare the cost-effectiveness
        of intensive SBP treatment implementation strategies, (3) engage local\\nstakeholders
        in study design and communication strategies, and (4) disseminate results
        to local and national\\nstakeholders to optimize intensive SBP treatment implementation.
        The central hypothesis is that intensive\\nSBP treatment implementation in
        health systems will be feasible and cost-effective in high CVD risk\\npatients
        compared to standard treatment even when considering local implementation
        factors.\\nMost past research using computer simulation methods generates
        “average” national population estimates and\\nthe models are often considered
        opaque “black boxes” by decision makers. This project is innovative as it\\napplies
        simulation methods to the local health system level, using local patient data,
        and engages local\\nstakeholders to address practical implementation barriers
        and facilitators. For intensive SBP treatment,\\nthis may result in more efficient
        and safer implementation, while also reducing the burden of CVD attributed
        to\\nraised SBP.\\nMy career goal is to become a principal investigator and
        expert focused on the use of computer simulations to\\nimprove healthcare
        delivery, quality, and population health. The proposed career development
        plan will\\nprovide training and mentorship in: (1) advanced computer simulation
        methods; (2) analysis of\\nindividual-level data from clinical trials, observational
        cohorts, national surveys, and health systems;\\n(3) qualitative methods;
        and (4) dissemination and communication of computer simulation research\\nresults.
        This training will be achieved through coursework, hands-on experience, and
        active mentoring. The\\nmentoring team is comprised of nationally recognized
        experts in hypertension, clinical trials, computer\\nsimulation, cost-effectiveness

        Summary\\nWomen who inject drugs (WWIDs) are at significantly higher risk
        of contracting HIV due to both needle sharing\\nand sexual behaviors, yet
        utilize HIV prevention resources less. Analysis of studies testing pre-exposure\\nprophylaxis
        (PrEP) has not tested effectiveness in WWIDs and little research exists on
        their specific barriers to\\nuptake and adherence. The result is a significant
        group who is highly vulnerable to HIV infection and its\\nnegative health
        consequences, yet is less likely to benefit from PrEP. Research is needed
        to understand how\\nWWIDs perceive HIV risk and PrEP, and whether a targeted
        intervention that is embedded in an existing and\\ntrusted syringe exchange
        program is feasible and holds promise in addressing structural barriers to
        accessing\\nPrEP and increasing its use in this at-risk population. To address
        this gap we will conduct a rigorous formative\\nevaluation utilizing a unique
        and innovative marketing evaluation technique. Using perceptual mapping and\\nvector
        modeling analysis, we will develop 3-D maps to identify specific message strategies
        to embed into an\\nintervention using targeted PrEP counseling, written materials,
        and text based messaging and pilot tested for\\npromise of efficacy compared
        to a general PrEP intervention. The intervention will address psycho-social\\nbarriers
        to PrEP through perceptual mapping but also societal and structural barriers
        by embedding it in a\\ntrusted syringe exchange and distributing medication
        through its medical clinic. Specific aims of the research\\nare: 1. Assess
        WWIDs' perceptions of PrEP and potential barriers to use. To accomplish this
        we will conduct\\nfocus groups (n=30) and interviews with syringe exchange
        staff (n=10) and develop a perceptual mapping\\nsurvey. 2. Develop a targeted
        communication intervention based on vector modeling findings, including print\\nmaterials,
        PrEP counseling, and text messages, and assess feasibility and acceptability.
        To accomplish this we\\nwill conduct perceptual mapping surveys with HIV-
        WWIDs (n=100), do vector modeling analysis and create\\nsample messages, concept
        test messages with WWIDs and staff (n=20), create intervention materials and\\nconduct
        usability testing (n=20). 3. Pilot test the intervention by integrating into
        a syringe exchange to assess\\npromise of efficacy. To accomplish this we
        will conduct a randomized pilot (n=50) and test an “enhanced”\\nintervention
        using targeted messages with a “basic” intervention that provides general
        PrEP counseling. To\\nassess promise of efficacy we will compare PrEP adherence
        (blood test; self report) and differences in PrEP\\nattitudes, self-efficacy,
        and decisional conflict. If successful, the proposed pilot study will significantly
        contribute\\nto HIV prevention by examining the unique perceptions of PrEP
        in WWIDs and the acceptability, feasibility, and\\npotential impact of using
        health communication strategies in adjunct with existing services in a social
        service\\nagency. This pilot will provide crucial information for a subsequent

        career as a physician scientist conducting patient-oriented research in childhood
        obesity. This award will support the candidate's training and attainment of
        expertise in three areas: qualitative research methods, cultural tailoring
        of technology-based interventions, and implementation science. This training
        will support his overall goals of designing and rigorously testing childhood
        obesity interventions that can be readily translated and disseminated and
        that will provide critical insight for care in diverse settings and patient
        groups. To achieve these goals, Dr. Haemer has assembled a cross-disciplinary
        mentoring team, each with outstanding experience in research methods and strong
        records of successful mentoring: Dr. Glasgow, a behavioral scientist who is
        renown within the field of implementation science; Dr. Bull, an expert researcher
        in technology-based health promotion; and Dr. Krebs, a pediatrician and nutrition
        specialist with extensive research and clinical experience in childhood obesity
        and with a long history of mentoring young investigators. The proposed research
        addresses the huge knowledge gap in cost-effective ways for the healthcare
        system to influence both patient-level and population-level outcomes for childhood
        obesity. Evidence-based approaches of surveillance, screening, prevention
        and treatment largely remain uncertain or untested, especially for the youngest
        children from groups at highest risk of obesity-related health disparity.
        This K23 award will study methods for prevention and treatment applied to
        Latino preschool-aged children from low- income families. The research will
        test the central hypothesis that culturally tailored screening and counseling
        will be more effective at decreasing BMI trajectory than usual care. Specific
        aims include: 1. To characterize components of primary care interactions that
        should be culturally tailored to enhance motivation for healthy lifestyle
        change among Latino parents with preschoolers 2. To design a technology-user
        interface that maximizes acceptance by Latino parents of young children. 3.
        To pilot test a technology-supported screening and counseling protocol tailored
        to Latino parents using findings of Aims 1 and 2. Using an implementation
        science perspective, we will assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation
        fidelity, and sustainable maintenance of the intervention in clinical practice
        during the pilot RCT. This research and training will form the basis for an
        RO1 proposal to test technology-supported childhood obesity prevention and
        treatment interventions targeting young children from low-income Latino families.

        ABSTRACT\\nThe overarching goal of this candidate's program of research is
        to improve behavioral and physical health and\\nreduce health disparities
        by using multimedia technology to deliver evidence-based interventions to\\nunderserved
        populations. The focus is sickle cell disease (SCD), a condition that disproportionately
        affects\\nthose of African descent. Many people living with SCD suffer from
        daily chronic pain as well as recurrent acute\\npain episodes that require
        medical attention. Opioid medication is the primary treatment for pain in
        SCD,\\ndespite its limited effectiveness and negative side-effects. The proposed
        K23 attempts to address the need for\\nan alternative, non-pharmacological
        pain treatment in SCD. Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT)\\nhas
        been found effective for reducing chronic pain and may be a low cost, easily
        accessible and scalable pain\\ntreatment in SCD. The candidate's K12 project
        tested a cCBT program for anxiety and depression; preliminary\\nresults suggest
        that patients liked using the program, but found that much of its content
        did not relate to their\\nlives. To address this limitation, the proposed
        K23 project will adapt an existing cCBT program for pain\\nmanagement to create
        ReThink Pain SCD, a culturally-tailored, mobile-phone delivered behavioral
        intervention\\ndesigned specifically to help African American patients self-manage
        chronic sickle cell pain. Aim 1: Modify and\\ntailor the generic cCBT pain
        program, using qualitative research methods to understand the needs and barriers\\nto
        pain management in patients with SCD, as well as the opportunities to engage
        this population using\\nmultimedia. These data will inform the development
        of the features and content of ReThink Pain SCD. Aim 2:\\nConduct a pilot
        pragmatic clinical trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing
        this pain\\nintervention into routine SCD care. Forty patients with SCD will
        be randomized to either receive 8 sessions of\\nthe cCBT program or 8 online
        education modules on a smartphone. Primary outcomes of the trial include\\nfeasibility
        (recruitment, retention, provider and patient feedback) and acceptability
        (sessions completed) of the\\nReThink Pain SCD program.\\nIn order to achieve
        the goals of this research plan and transition to independence, the candidate
        requires\\nfurther training in user-centered design, implementation science,
        design and conduct of pragmatic clinical\\ntrials, and team management and
        leadership. This proposal includes an exceptional team of mentors and\\nconsultants.

        SUMMARY\\nIn the United States, firefighters and emergency medical technicians
        (EMTs)/ paramedics respond to more than 50 million\\nemergency calls annually.
        The daily operations and experiences that are expected and accepted as part
        of their job expose\\nthem to various traumatic events (e.g. school shootings,
        suicides). The nature, frequency, and intensity of duty-related\\ntraumatic
        exposures place these first responders (FRs) at significant risk for mental
        health (MH) problems, such as post-\\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
        suicide. However, due to the stigma of mental illness and the culture of self-reliance\\nand
        strength that surrounds FRs, few are willing to seek help. In a preliminary
        study conducted by the Principal\\nInvestigator, community partnerships were
        established with key FR stakeholders throughout Arkansas to discuss MH-\\nrelated
        issues. They unanimously expressed concern about the increased prevalence
        of MH problems and lack of help-\\nseeking among FRs in the state. Hence,
        we propose an exploratory, qualitative study that will use a statewide community-\\nengagement
        approach to conceptualize a MH service model that FRs will be willing to access
        and use. Our specific aims\\nare to: AIM 1) Identify FRs' preferences and
        priorities regarding MH service and delivery methods, including the\\nfeasibility,
        acceptability, and value of each method. To address this aim, we will use
        opt-in methods to recruit a diverse\\ngroup of firefighters and EMTs/paramedics
        from across Arkansas to participate in qualitative interviews, defined as
        focus\\ngroups and individual interviews. After all qualitative interviews
        have been analyzed, we will initiate a series of product\\ndevelopment activities
        to achieve AIM 2) Conceptualize a MH service model, in partnership with FRs
        statewide, that is\\napplicable, acceptable, and feasible for implementation.
        In collaboration with our community partners, and based on the\\npreferences
        and priorities identified by FRs, a hybrid Delphi technique of consensus formation
        will be used to\\nconceptualize a MH service model that is acceptable to FRs
        and feasible to implement in real world settings, which aligns\\nwith the
        National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Priorities (Strategic
        Objective 4.1 and 4.2). Through this\\nwork, we will generate the scientific
        foundation to develop a comprehensive, MH service model that will motivate\\nengagement
        in services by diverse FRs. We expect this model will encompass a range of
        services, such as awareness,\\nprevention, treatment, and crisis management
        strategies to meet FRs' MH needs throughout the course of illness. This\\nstudy's
        findings will guide a multi-stage, research agenda that will include: 1) development
        and pilot testing of the MH\\nservice model (Strategic Objective 4.3), 2)
        a full-scale trial of the program statewide, revised based on pilot results,
        and 3)\\na hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial (Strategic Objective
        4.4). Ultimately, promoting engagement in MH services\\nmay decrease suicide
        rates and improve the overall MH outcomes among this at-risk population. With
        continued efforts\\nand partnerships, findings can be integrated into policy
        and funding-related decision making to sustain the delivery of\\nhigh-quality
        MH services for FRs in Arkansas and across the nation.\",\"project_title\":\"Building

        (provided by applicant): Candidate: Dr. Steffani Bailey has her PhD in clinical
        psychology and is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Family
        Medicine at Oregon Health & Science University. Dr. Bailey has conducted lab-based
        studies on craving processes, and directed two randomized clinical trials
        for smoking cessation in community- based populations. She has 19 peer-reviewed
        publications, with 9 as first author. Dr. Bailey's previous research experience
        in smoking cessation, the training activities proposed in the K23 application,
        and her multidisciplinary team of mentors, will provide her with the expertise
        and guidance necessary to become an independent investigator in primary care
        smoking cessation research with underserved populations. Research Focus: Electronic
        health records (EHR) are increasingly being used to prompt health care providers
        to assess and treat tobacco use, as well as to document that these services
        were rendered. The United States Congress passed legislation (\\\"meaningful
        use\\\" of EHR) that could increase the use of the EHR for both assessing
        smoking status and providing cessation assistance in clinics serving Medicaid
        and Medicare patients. EHRs can aid in the ability to track the progress on
        selected indicators and can be utilized in research to identify important
        information about subpopulations that are less likely to\\nbe getting the
        standard of care for tobacco use treatment. Although research has shown that
        EHR use does increase the number of unique patients asked about smoking status,
        research is mixed on whether use of this technology increases rates of quitting
        advice or smoking cessation. The study will use quantitative data from OCHIN,
        a multiple-facility, linked EHR provider, and qualitative data from clinic
        observations and interviews with health care providers and patients. This
        mixed-methods study will 1) evaluate whether implementation of Stage 1 Meaningful
        Use of EHRs for smoking indicators, which includes changes to the EHR vital
        signs section, increases rates of assessing smoking status and readiness to
        quit, and smoking cessation assistance, 2) identify patient, provider, and
        clinic characteristics associated with rates of smoking assessment and delivery
        of cessation services, and 3) identify factors that promote and hinder smoking
        cessation treatment in primary care settings through clinic observations and
        interviews with both health care providers and patients. This research will
        inform the development of a primary care-based smoking cessation intervention
        that utilizes health information technology, as well as develop Dr. Bailey's
        career in primary care research focused on underserved populations. Training
        goals: Dr. Bailey's training goals include 1) developing an advanced understanding
        of facilitators and barriers to the assessment and treatment of smoking in
        federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs), including use of health information
        technology, 2) increasing her knowledge of health disparities in underserved
        populations, 3) developing skills in qualitative methodology and mixed methods
        research, including advanced biostatistical analysis. Environment: Dr. Bailey
        will undergo her career development in the Department of Family Medicine at
        Oregon Health & Science University, an organization with significant and longstanding
        resources for early-career researchers. She has strong institutional and departmental
        support. Methods: Using EHR data from 21 FQHC primary care clinics, and random
        effects Poisson regression, Dr. Bailey will evaluate whether implementation
        of Stage 1 Meaningful Use increases the rates of assessing smoking status
        and readiness to quit, and providing smoking cessation assistance (Aim 1).
        Using 2014 EHR data from 69 FQHC primary care clinics, she will conduct logistic
        generalized estimating equation regression analyses to examine associations
        between patient, provider, and clinic-level characteristics and rates of the
        assessment and treatment of smoking (Aim 2). Finally, using qualitative methods,
        she will identify facilitators and barriers to smoking cessation treatment
        in FQHCs. She will collect this data through patient and provider interviews
        and observations of clinics with the highest and lowest rates of smoking cessation
        assistance (Aim 3). Outcomes: These results will aid in determining whether
        resources being invested in the meaningful use of EHR are producing any measurable
        changes and how they might need to be improved. Findings from this study can
        inform policy and clinical practices, particularly in primary care settings
        that provide services to underserved populations with higher than average
        smoking rates. Results from this study will inform the design of a future
        intervention for smoking cessation in FQHCs that will be proposed in an R01
        application during the latter years of the award period.\",\"project_title\":\"Meaningful

        Summary:\\nYoung gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM)
        are disproportionately affected by HIV.\\nDespite this burden, most HIV prevention
        interventions target adult MSM (most of whom identify as gay) and\\nheterosexual
        youth, creating an urgent need for interventions for gay and bisexual adolescents.
        Further, self-\\nidentified bisexual men, especially adolescents, have been
        neglected in research. This is a critical problem\\nbecause: (1) there are
        as many, if not more, bisexual adolescent men than gay adolescent men; (2)
        bisexual\\nadolescent men engage in several HIV risk behaviors more than their
        gay peers; (3) bisexual adolescent men\\nare at increased risk for substance
        use–a robust risk factor for HIV; and (4) bisexual men face unique HIV\\nprevention
        issues. Given that bisexual men are rarely included in research and most existing
        research on them\\nfocuses on “behaviorally bisexual” adult men, little is
        known about factors that drive engagement in risk behavior\\namong self-identified
        bisexual adolescent men. Attending to bisexual identity is critical to reducing
        HIV and\\nsubstance use, because bisexuality is highly stigmatized and stigma-related
        stressors (e.g., concerns about\\ndisclosing one’s bisexual identity) impact
        sexual behavior, substance use, and healthcare utilization.\\nInterventions
        are also more effective when tailored to populations, underscoring the need
        for an intervention for\\nself-identified bisexual adolescent men. The goals
        of this study are to: (1) examine factors that drive engagement\\nin HIV risk
        behavior and substance use among self-identified bisexual adolescent men;
        and (2) develop and pilot\\ntest a tailored HIV and substance use prevention
        intervention for this population. In Phase 1, interviews will be\\nconducted
        with 60 diverse self-identified bisexual adolescent men ages 14-17 focused
        on sexual identity, sexual\\ndecision-making, substance use motivations, and
        intervention preferences/barriers. In Phase 2, a tailored\\nintervention will
        be developed using findings from Phase 1. In Phase 3, feasibility, acceptability,
        and preliminary\\nefficacy will be tested in a pilot randomized trial (N =
        60) with a waitlist control and one-month follow-up. This\\naward will provide
        the applicant with career development training in adolescent health, qualitative
        methods, and\\nintervention development at Northwestern University’s Institute
        for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and\\nWellbeing–a well-resourced, rich
        intellectual environment for training scholars in sexual and gender minority\\nhealth

        transition to an independent\\ninvestigator with a program of research focused
        on understanding and eliminating HIV and substance use\\ndisparities affecting
        bisexual men. In sum, self-identified bisexual adolescent men are at increased
        risk for HIV\\nand substance use, but little is known about factors that drive
        their engagement in risk behavior. By focusing on\\nself-identified bisexual
        adolescent men–an underrepresented, health disparity population–this study

        Summary/Abstract\\nThis project will use mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative)
        to evaluate the impact of\\nmarijuana policy changes on patterns of use of
        marijuana and other harmful substances among\\npeople living with HIV (PLWH).
        PLWH are a key population given their high prevalence of\\nmarijuana use and
        potential for marijuana-related adverse outcomes. We will analyze the rich\\ndata
        available through the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical

        of >32,000 PLWH in care in 8\\nregions across the U.S. CNICS' comprehensive
        clinical data includes laboratory data (CD4, HIV\\nRNA levels), medications,
        diagnoses (substance use disorders, mental health disorders),\\npatient-reported
        outcomes (PROs) with >70,000 comprehensive substance use assessments,\\nand
        health care utilization such as primary care visits and missed visits. Ongoing

        including areas like San Diego,\\nSeattle, and Boston with recent regulatory
        changes and areas like Baltimore and Birmingham\\nwithout regulatory changes
        will enable this project. We will examine marijuana use among\\nPLWH using
        joint longitudinal and survival models to estimate associations with\\npolicy/regulation.
        We will also evaluate the association between marijuana use changes and risk\\nbehaviors,
        such as binge drinking, among PLWH. We will additionally employ qualitative\\nmethods
        including focus groups and structured interviews to evaluate changing usage
        patterns,\\nbeliefs, and health behaviors over periods experiencing regulatory
        changes. We expect that the\\nmajority of increases in marijuana use will

        SUMMARY\\nMortality in sickle cell disease (SCD) has shifted away from childhood
        and to young adulthood, with patients\\nfacing an increased risk of early
        mortality after leaving pediatric care. Lack of transition preparation and
        poor\\nsupport for the development of self-management skills play a significant
        role in the adverse transition\\noutcomes in this vulnerable population. It
        is therefore imperative to develop novel methods of self-management\\nsupport
        to prepare adolescents with SCD to manage their own health prior to leaving
        pediatric care. Problem\\nsolving, a key component of many chronic disease
        self-management programs, helps individuals overcome\\nbarriers to self-management.
        This makes problem solving an appealing intervention for adolescents with
        SCD\\nwho face myriad social challenges associated with race and poverty while
        being expected to learn how to\\nmanage a complicated chronic disease. This
        proposal describes a four year integrated research and education\\nplan to
        tailor and pilot-test an existing problem solving intervention developed by
        my primary mentors to\\nimprove self-management and transition readiness in
        adolescents with SCD. My specific research aims are to:\\n1) conduct focus
        groups of adolescents with SCD and their parents to identify plausible intervention
        targets for\\nhow problem solving strategies could impact SCD self-management;
        2) tailor the generic problem solving\\nmodel to the specific function of
        improving self-management for adolescents with SCD based on the plausible\\nintervention
        targets identified in our first aim; and 3) conduct a single-arm adaptive
        pilot test of the tailored\\nintervention in order to optimize the content
        and delivery of the intervention through an iterative series of\\nquality
        improvement Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles. My educational objectives are to gain
        additional training in 1)\\nhealth behavior change, including normal adolescent
        development, and problem solving as a cognitive-based\\nbehavior change strategy;
        2) intervention development, including the use of qualitative methods to enhance\\ncultural
        competency; and 3) clinical trial design, including rigorous pilot methodologies
        and the design and\\nconduct of definitive trials. The results of this award
        will prepare me for my long term career goal as an\\nindependent investigator
        focused on developing and evaluating interventions to improve transition for\\nadolescents
        with SCD. The research in this application builds directly on my prior work
        which has focused on\\nmeasuring transition readiness and developing quality
        metrics for transition in SCD. I have put together an\\nexperienced mentoring
        team within a supportive research environment to help me gain the expertise\\nnecessary
        to be successful in this work and in my long term career goals. The results
        of this project will lead\\ndirectly to a subsequent grant to conduct a multi-site
        RCT of our tailored intervention and will help establish my\\ncareer as an

        in the context of the many large HIV-focused clinical trials and studies that
        Dr.\\nLockman leads (and led over the past 18 years) in Botswana and elsewhere,
        ranging from randomized\\ntrials of antiretroviral or antibiotic regimens

        greater) of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage, and\\nvirologic
        suppression (“90-90-90” targets) to end the HIV epidemic. However, despite
        nearly meeting these\\ntargets in Botswana, we observe annual HIV incidence
        >1%. Furthermore, with more than 15% of the adult\\npopulation of Botswana

        we\\nunderstand the implications of widespread treatment for clinical outcomes

        SUMMARY\\nIn the US, roughly one in five children experiences a mental health
        problem severe enough to warrant\\ndiagnosis and intervention. The education
        sector offers compelling opportunities to improve service access, but\\nschool
        mental health (SMH) providers are unlikely to deliver high-quality evidence-based
        practices (EBP),\\ndramatically reducing the public health impact of these
        services. Multiple barriers interfere with SMH providers\\nreceiving adequate
        training and support in EBP, including limited time and scarce training resources.
        The goal\\nof this project is to improve school-based care by developing and
        testing an online training and consultation\\nsystem to facilitate use of
        routine outcome monitoring (ROM), an EBP with extensive empirical support
        and a\\nfeasible and cost-effective minimal intervention necessary for change.
        Although ROM is not routinely used by\\nSMH providers, our preliminary work
        has found that targeted training can improve ROM uptake. Unfortunately,\\ndue
        to issues such as time, training resources, and practitioner geographic dispersion,
        especially in rural areas\\n(<1 practitioner per school), ROM training is
        inaccessible to many SMH providers. Online training (OLT)\\naddresses these
        barriers. In addition, because OLT is self-paced and flexible, it is associated
        with lower levels\\nof provider burnout. OLT is also cost effective and scalable
        because its only requirements are internet access\\nand server support. Regardless
        of the training modality, post-training consultation is essential for practitioner\\nbehavior
        change. To be optimally effective, consultation needs to be collaborative
        and responsive to learner\\nneeds. Using user-centered design methodology,
        which emphasizes iterative development of parsimonious\\nand compelling products,
        the current R34 proposal will maximize the feasibility, usability, and efficiency
        of an\\ninnovative approach to OLT and follow-up consultation for SMH clinicians
        – Brief Online Training (BOLT) for\\nROM. In Aim 1, we will develop the OLT
        platform via iterative prototyping and continuous user testing to\\noptimize
        system usability and training's impact on provider knowledge and attitudes
        about ROM. In Aim 2, we\\nwill iteratively develop BOLT post-training consultation
        procedures to optimize putative mechanisms of\\neffective consultation: consultant
        collaboration & responsiveness. In Aim 3, we will conduct a pilot randomized\\ncontrolled
        trial of the full BOLT training/consultation package to test (1) BOLT effects
        on ROM knowledge,\\nattitudes, and weekly assessments of ROM use; (2) the
        incremental impact of consultation dosage on ROM\\nuse; and (3) mechanisms
        of BOLT impact, including (a) platform usability, (b) clinician knowledge
        and attitude\\ngains, (c) collaboration, and (d) responsiveness of consultation.
        This project will yield feasibility data to inform a\\nsubsequent effectiveness-implementation

        its impact on youth outcomes.\",\"project_title\":\"Brief Online Training

        raises multiple ELSI (ethical, legal, social, and policy) concerns. The proposed\\n“embedded

        the ELSI issues\\nthat accompany a pioneering randomized pragmatic clinical
        trial of a risk-based approach to breast\\ncancer screening. The Athena WISDOM
        study is a clinical trial (n=100K) that uses genomics to determine the\\nappropriate
        use of mammography, and other forms of breast cancer screening, across the
        population. Breast\\ncancer is among the most feared diseases; current screening
        technologies raise multiple anxieties, fueled by a\\nhigh rate of false positive
        results. Recently funded by PCORI (the Patient Centered Outcomes Research\\nInitiative)
        the WISDOM trial is significant because it is the first effort to target breast
        cancer screening\\naccording to individual genomic risk, as opposed to population
        characteristics. Based on a partnership\\nwith Color Genomics, the WISDOM
        trial creates a personalized risk score based on mutations in nine highly\\npenetrant
        cancer genes (BRCA1/2, TP53, PTEN, STK11, CDH1, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2), as well
        as 157 SNP\\nvariants that are associated with increased risk. The final score
        also incorporates standard risk assessments\\nsuch as family history and breast
        density. The proposed ELSI investigation builds on preliminary work\\nconducted
        by investigators at UCSF's “Center of Excellence in ELSI Research” who received
        a pilot award to\\ncreate a multi-disciplinary research team; the team formed
        (a breast surgeon, an anthropologist/bioethicist, and\\na molecular pathologist)
        developed this proposal. Our collaborative project “embeds” a comprehensive
        ELSI\\nstudy within the Athena Breast Health Network's WISDOM study. The ELSI
        project has 4 specific aims. We\\nseek to: 1) examine how ELSI concerns are
        addressed throughout the implementation of the WISDOM\\ntrial via ethnography
        and key informant interviews with stakeholders. 2) elucidate the experience
        and\\nmeanings of risk-based screening for trial participants and their primary
        care providers (PCPs) via\\nqualitative interviews with women stratified by
        risk level, focus groups with PCPs, and a survey of the full trial\\ncohort.
        3) explore the consequences of receiving a positive result for one of the
        nine high penetrance\\ncancer susceptibility genes via observations of genetic
        counseling sessions, qualitative interviews at two\\ntime points, a survey,
        and focus groups with WISDOM study breast health specialists. 4) convene an

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    \\nAphasia is a communication
        disorder that affects 80,000 people per year and estimates suggest that VHA
        outpatient clinics see 2000 new cases of aphasia each year. As in other healthcare
        disciplines, speech-language pathologists are increasingly called upon to
        document the impact of their interventions with respect to functioning, activities,
        and social participation. One response has been the development of patient-reported
        outcome (PRO) measures for a range of health conditions. The goal of this
        proposal is to enhance the validity and clinically utility o a new PRO measure
        for veterans with aphasia, the Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure (ACOM).
        This tool will assist clinicians and researchers in responding to growing
        mandates to focus on patients' experiences in improving the quality and efficiency
        of care. In the initial fiel trial of the ACOM, a plausible and clinically
        useful measurement model for the ACOM was identified; its covariance-based
        reliability was estimated to be high; and it was found to correlat positively
        with other measures of communicative functioning and language performance
        as predicted. The next steps in maximizing the ACOM's clinical utility are
        to assess its sensitivity t change over time, the stability of its measurement
        model, and its relationships to other relevant variables. First, the responsiveness
        of the ACOM to treatment-related change will be assessed in collaboration
        with 3 independent VA RR&D-funded treatment studies by collecting pre- and
        post-treatment data from at least 60 participants to test whether the ACOM
        demonstrates reliable positive change in response to treatment. Estimates
        of its responsiveness and minimally important difference scores will be obtained.
        Second, confirmatory tests of the ACOM measurement model and the stability
        of its item parameters will be conducted in a sample of 300 participants with
        aphasia in order to verify that its internal structure applies to the intende
        population. Test-retest stability of score estimates in the absence of treatment
        will also be assessed this sample. Third, in a sub-sample of 240 participants
        with aphasia, correlations among the ACOM, a performance-based measure of
        language impairment, and concurrent PRO measures of communication, cognitive,
        and physical functioning will be estimated to evaluate convergence with more
        related constructs and discriminant evidence for less related constructs.
        We will also use data collected from this subsample to assess the unique contribution
        of ACOM for predicting communication-related well-being over and above a measure
        of language impairment and a PRO measure of general negative mood. The outcomes
        of this proposal will include (1) estimates of the responsiveness of the ACOM
        to treatment and benchmarks for interpretation, (2) evidence supporting the
        validity of the ACOM's internal structure and the stability of its item parameters,
        and (2) evidence supporting claims that the ACOM in fact measures the underlying
        construct of patient-reported communicative functioning.\",\"project_title\":\"Responsiveness,

        with a\\nspecial focus on the emergency medicine and primary care settings.
        In addition, the purpose of the training is\\nto gain advanced skills to study
        the MBIs alone and in combination with nutraceuticals and medications. The\\nresearch
        proposed in this K23 application is important to understanding how evidence-based
        MBIs can be\\nmade more accessible for chronic pain patients in the acute

        MBIs into use in other medical settings. Migraine, the chronic pain condition
        being\\nused as an example for study, is a significant public health issue.
        Migraine affects over 30 million Americans,\\nand it is considered to be one
        of the most disabling conditions. It is responsible for a substantial number
        of the\\nfive million headache visits/year to US EDs. The purpose of this
        research is to study use of progressive muscle\\nrelaxation, a MBI, in patients
        with migraine who present to the emergency department. During the study, we\\nwill
        use patient feedback to optimize the smartphone application (app) RELAXaHEAD,
        an app with PMR and a\\ndaily headache diary. We will then conduct a feasibility
        and acceptability study of the RELAX approach (use of\\nRELAXaHEAD and abortive
        migraine pain medication). The results of this research will inform a future

        cause of mortality in the United States and the foremost cause of cancer deaths.
        There are concerns that the decrease in cigarette smoking attained over the
        last several decades is now challenged by the increasing popularity of non-traditional
        tobacco products such as Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), commonly
        referred to as e-cigarettes. The effects of ENDS use on public health are
        not well understood, including its plausible effects on cigarette use initiation,
        re-uptake, and maintenance. Currently, ENDS face limited regulations in the
        U.S. ENDS marketing in particular is not regulated. However, the prevalence
        of ENDS use is rapidly increasing, especially among young adults (18-25 year
        olds) who appear to be the main target of ENDS marketing. Current studies
        on ENDS marketing have been mostly qualitative, focused on characterizing
        the contents of advertising or retail marketing. These studies suggest that
        ENDS are being promoted to attract youth/young adults and as safer alternatives
        to cigarettes. But there is little evidence available on the effects of ENDS
        marketing on young adults' beliefs and attitudes and how those beliefs and
        attitudes promote ENDS use, and by extension, cigarette use. Elucidating the
        mechanisms of how ENDS marketing operates to impact young adults' ENDS use
        and smoking behavior could provide specific directions to the development
        of regulations on ENDS marketing as well as ENDS/tobacco control media interventions.
        For example, policies and media interventions could be informed as to which
        aspects of ENDS marketing need to be controlled and countered. This research
        will employ longitudinal design and the dual- process theoretical framework
        to determine the roles of outcome expectancies and implicit attitudes in explaining
        the effects of ENDS marketing on ENDS and cigarette use progression among
        college students, including cigarette use initiation and re-uptake. Guided
        by our preliminary research, we specifically focus on 4 positive outcome expectancies:
        social enhancement (e.g., use to gain popularity), affect regulation (e.g.,
        use to regulate feelings), positive sensory experience (e.g., use to enjoy
        flavors), and positive health consequences. Consistent with the dual-process
        framework, which posits that spontaneous or automatic processes act parallel
        in decision-making to more conscious, reflective processes, we hypothesize
        that the effects of marketing on ENDS and cigarette use are mediated or explained
        by the 4 types of expectancies, jointly representing the reflective system,
        and by implicit attitudes, representing the spontaneous system. Spontaneous
        processes have never been assessed as mediators of the effects of tobacco
        product marketing on behavior in general and of ENDS marketing in particular.
        The multi-wave longitudinal design will facilitate rigorous causal inferences
        regarding the mechanisms of how ENDS marketing operates as well as help investigate
        marketing's role in young adults' changes in beliefs, attitudes and behavior
        over time. Thus, this research will employ powerful theoretical and methodological
        approaches and measures newly applied to ENDS research [e.g., Implicit Association
        Test (IAT)] to generate high quality information that currently does not exist.\",\"project_title\":\"Prospective

        up innovative and sustainable delivery of evidence-based mental health interventions
        for youth exposed to violence and other forms of adversity across a range
        of delivery settings; and (b) to serve as a global hub for capacity building

        the expertise and resources of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health,
        University of Georgia College of Public Health, CARITAS, World Bank, the governments
        of Sierra Leone and Liberia, and a network of youth service providers and
        universities. A proposed Scale-Up Study will use a hybrid implementation-
        effectiveness trial design across N=24 youth employment programs to evaluate
        an innovative approach to training and supervision-Interagency Collaborative
        Teams (ICTs)-and their influence on integration, fidelity, cost and sustainment
        of a quality mental health intervention-the Youth Readiness Intervention (YRI)-into
        a national youth employment program-the Youth Employment Scheme (YES). The

        functioning and economic self-sufficiency among N=960 Sierra Leonean male
        and female youth aged 15-24 over time to determine effects of the YRI when
        implemented under this new delivery platform. Guided by the EPIS implementation
        model, qualitative data on attitudes towards mental health and barriers and
        facilitators to the integration of mental health services into youth employment
        programs will be collected. A Capacity Building Core will build sustainable
        capacity to conduct and apply mental health services and implementation research

        Core will provide opportunities for on-the-job learning in quantitative and
        qualitative research to increase capacity for implementation science. These
        capacity building efforts will accelerate the scale up of evidence-based mental

        SUMMARY/ABSTRACT\\nPediatric obesity affects 1 in 3 children in the US and
        represents a public health crisis [1]. In utero exposure to\\nmaternal obesity
        and caesarean section (C-section) are independently and jointly associated
        with offspring\\nobesity [2, 3]. Accumulating data suggests maternal obesity
        and C-section may seed an “obesogenic”\\nmicrobiome responsible for transmitting
        obesity risk from mother to child [4, 5]. Exclusive breastfeeding is\\nassociated
        with protection against pediatric obesity [6]; however, the association between
        human milk\\ncomponents and the microbiome that account for these observations
        are poorly characterized. Recent advances\\nin untargeted metabolomics provides
        a novel opportunity to comprehensively investigate how the human milk\\nmetabolome
        in combination with microbe-host interactions are associated with infant adiposity
        during the first\\nyear of life.\\nThe Principal Investigator, Dr. Dominick
        J. Lemas, Ph.D. will use high-resolution mass spectrometry as a tool to\\ninterrogate
        the human milk metabolome and infant microbiome in a longitudinal maternal-infant
        cohort of obese\\nand normal weight mothers that includes vaginally and cesarean
        section deliveries. The over-arching hypothesis\\nof this proposal is that
        the human milk metabolome will be associated with novel changes in the early
        infant\\nmicrobiome that alter risk for obesity and weight gain in the first
        year of life. In collaboration with a\\nmultidisciplinary team of expert mentors
        (including primary mentor Dr. Christian Jobin and co-mentors Drs. Josef\\nNeu,
        Timothy Garrett, William Hogan, Janice Krieger), the primary goal of this
        K01 career development proposal\\nis for Dr. Lemas to develop expertise in
        high-resolution metabolomics, biomedical informatics and longitudinal\\nclinical
        microbiome studies. The University of Florida (UF) boasts an intellectually
        rich research environment that\\nwill facilitate these goals. More specifically,
        longitudinal data collection will be completed at the NIH-funded UF\\nClinical
        and Translational Science Institute and human milk and stool metabolomics
        analysis will be completed\\nat the NIH-funded UF Southeast Center for Integrated
        Metabolomics (SECIM). Finally, microbial sequencing will\\nbe completed at
        the UF NextGeneration DNA Sequencing Core and high-throughput data analysis
        will be\\ncompleted at the UF Research Computing Center.\\nSpecific Aim 1
        will generate a data-driven recruitment plan using informant interviews and
        qualitative methods\\nto identify barriers and facilitators to successful
        participant recruitment and strategies. Specific Aim 2 will\\ncharacterize
        the role of the human milk metabolome on the development of the infant microbiome.
        Specific Aim\\n3 will identify how the human milk metabolome is associated
        with infant adiposity. The proposed research is\\nfocused on the pathophysiology
        of infant growth and adiposity during early life and will inform subsequent
        studies\\nthat seek to reduce the risk of pediatric obesity. The structured

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large-scale implementation of evidence-based
        psychotherapies (EBPs) such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for Post-traumatic
        Stress Disorder can have a tremendous impact on mental and physical health,
        healthcare utilization, and quality of life. While many mental health systems
        have invested heavily in programs to implement EBPs, recent research has revealed
        a number of challenges to long-term sustainability and high- quality provision
        of these treatments. Few eligible patients receive EBPs in routine care settings,
        and clinicians do not appear to deliver the full treatment protocol to many
        of their patients. Emerging evidence suggest that when CPT and other EBPs
        are delivered at low levels of fidelity, clinical outcomes are negatively
        impacted. Clinicians have identified a number of reasons that they do not
        deliver EBPs that are related to the fit between the EBP and their patients
        or the clinical setting. To date, there is a dearth of guidance on how best
        to support and sustain high-quality EBP delivery. While some systems have
        policies and programs in place to support EBP implementation at the organization
        level, little is known about how to address remaining barriers that have been
        identified by clinicians. Identifying strategies to improve and sustain the
        delivery of CPT and other EBPs is therefore critical. Two competing strategies
        have been suggested in the existing literature. One emphasizes fidelity to
        the treatment protocol through ongoing consultation and fidelity monitoring.
        The other focuses on improving the fit and effectiveness of these treatments
        by making appropriate adaptations to the treatment or the clinical setting
        through a process of data-driven, continuous quality improvement. Neither
        has been evaluated in terms of impact on sustained implementation. To compare
        these approaches on key sustainability outcomes and provide some of the first
        guidance on strategies to promote sustainment, we propose a cluster randomized
        trial with mental health clinics (n=32) in three diverse mental health systems
        that have implemented CPT. Cohorts of clinicians and clinical managers will
        participate in one year of a fidelity oriented consultation or one year of
        a continuous quality improvement-oriented learning collaborative. Patient-level
        PTSD symptom change, fidelity and adaptation of CPT, penetration, and clinics'
        capacity to deliver EBP will be examined. Survey and interview data will also
        be collected to investigate multilevel influences on the success of the two
        implementation strategies. This research will be conducted by a team of investigators
        with expertise in CPT implementation, mixed-methods research strategies, quality
        improvement, and implementation science, with input from stakeholders in each
        participating mental health system. It will have broad implications for supporting
        ongoing delivery of EBPs in mental health and healthcare systems and settings.
        The resulting products have the potential to significantly improve efforts
        to ensure ongoing high quality implementation and consumer access to EBPs.\",\"project_title\":\"Improving

        support to Amy Linsky, MD, MSc toward her goal of developing into a VA independent
        investigator and expert on medication safety research. Dr. Linsky is a general
        internist and an investigator in the HSR&D Center for Organization, Leadership,
        and Management Research (COLMR) at VA Boston Healthcare System. This proposal
        delineates the research and training objectives that will lead to Dr. Linsky's
        maturation into an independent health services researcher while contributing
        to the fields of patient safety and quality of care, especially as thy pertain
        to appropriate medication use.  The first proposed research objective will
        center on elucidating Veterans' and clinicians' perspectives on intentional
        medication discontinuation, a part of the prescribing process that to date
        has not been explored. Building on qualitative work in progress, Dr. Linsky
        will develop two survey instruments: one to elicit patients' attitudes and
        beliefs and the other to understand how clinicians view overmedication and
        potential medication discontinuation. Bringing the Veterans' preferences into
        clinical decision making is concordant with other efforts in the VA to promote
        patient-centered care.  The VA is a vanguard of health information technology,
        with a well-established and integrated electronic health record. Despite this,
        medication discrepancies, with potential to cause serious harm to patients,
        persist. One type of discrepancy, therapeutic duplication, can lead to unintentional
        overdose. The second research objective proposes to identify the prevalence
        of this safety concern within VA nationally and to identify correlates of
        these duplications.  To effect meaningful change in prescribing, the results
        of these first two research objectives will be combined with relevant findings

        treatment\\n(ART) to all pregnant and breastfeeding women under Option B+
        has the potential to change the trajectory of\\nthe HIV epidemic. However,
        in order for the potential of Option B+ to be realized, women must be retained
        in\\nHIV care and those who are lost to follow-up (LTFU) must be re-engaged
        in care. Few efforts to re-engage\\nwomen in HIV care exist. Routine HIV program
        monitoring is an evidence-based intervention that is vital to\\ntrack women's
        engagement in HIV care under Option B+, but is limited in its ability accurately
        distinguish\\nwomen who are LTFU from those who have transferred to another
        HIV clinic. Identifying women who are LTFU\\nis essential for timely re-engagement
        in HIV care. The goal of the proposed project is to evaluate whether\\nenhancing
        HIV program monitoring with technology may be an implementation strategy to
        accurately identify\\nwomen who are LTFU. The project goal will be achieved
        through the following four Specific Aims: K99/1) To\\nexplore attitudes towards
        using technology for HIV program monitoring, K99/2) To assess the feasibility
        and\\nacceptability of 3 implementation strategies to improve HIV program

        fellowship serves two overarching goals: 1) To enhance my quantitative and
        qualitative research methods skills toward applying for and obtaining a mixed

        conducting a dissertation research project to understand the effect of the
        changing food environment on obesity in a historically low-socioeconomic status
        (SES) community of color undergoing gentrification. Background: Since the
        late 1990s, the neighborhood of Central Harlem in New York City has been undergoing
        dramatic transformation as characterized by gentrification, a mixture of divestment
        and redevelopment. These changes influence the food environment (i.e. grocery
        outlets, restaurants, street vendors, and farmers' markets) and, with it,
        residents' food-related practices and health. Given the high rates of nutrition-related
        conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in Harlem,
        any transformation in its food environment raises the need for investigation.
        The overarching question of my dissertation is: How does the changing food
        environment in Harlem, a neighborhood undergoing gentrification, affect residents'
        risk for obesity mediated by food-related dispositions and practices? Aims:
        The specific aims are to: 1) Examine changes in Central Harlem's food environment
        during 1990-2010 by analyzing the NETS database; 2) Examine whether longitudinal
        changes in the food practices of mothers and children are associated with
        changes in weight measurements and risk for obesity using the Columbia Center
        of Children's Environmental Health (CCCEH) cohort data; 2a) Compare changes
        in the weights of mothers and children who have remained in Central Harlem
        and those who have moved from the neighborhood; 3) Use ethnographic methods
        (including participant observation, and in-depth interviews with a sub-set
        of CCCEH participants) and key informant interviews to explore ongoing changes
        in Harlem's food environment, and how these changes affect food practices
        and dispositions, thus corroborating and expanding upon the quantitative findings
        under Aims 1 and 2; and 4) Integrate the quantitative and qualitative findings
        and thus develop a provisional conceptual framework to understand the effects
        of gentrification on obesity as mediated by food practices and dispositions.
        Methods: Consistent with my training objectives, the study will apply an ethnographic
        and sociological framework of habitus to examine the relationship between
        gentrification, habitus and obesity prevalence among residents of a historically
        resource poor neighborhood. Specifically, I will conduct a mixed methods explanatory
        sequential design including three phases: 1) secondary longitudinal data analyses
        of the National Establishments Time-Series database and CCCEH mother-child
        pairs; 2) qualitative data collection and analysis by employing an ethnography
        of Harlem's food environment and interview with 15- 20 key informants and
        45 CCCEH participants; and 3) integration of findings to develop a provisional
        conceptual framework that illustrates the effect o gentrification on obesity
        as mediated by food habitus.\",\"project_title\":\"Gentrification, food environment,

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bridging Income Generation with
        Group Integrated Care (BIGPIC) Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading
        cause of mortality in the world. Diabetes, a major risk factor for CVD, is
        increasingly prevalent and responsible for substantial cardiovascular morbidity
        and mortality. Elevated blood pressure (BP) increases CVD risk among individuals
        with diabetes and pre-diabetes; BP control is therefore a powerful way to
        reduce CVD risk. Cost-effective, context-specific, and culturally appropriate
        interventions are critical, and both group medical visits and microfinance
        have the potential to achieve this. In partnership with the Government of
        Kenya, the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare Partnership has expanded
        its clinical scope of work in rural western Kenya to include diabetes and
        hypertension, and has piloted group care and microfinance initiatives with
        promising early results. However, the effectiveness of these strategies individually,
        and in combination, on improving CVD risk is not known. Thus, the overall
        objective of this proposal is to utilize a transdisciplinary implementation
        research approach to address the challenge of reducing CVD risk in low-resource
        settings. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that group medical
        visits integrated into microfinance groups will be effective and cost-effective
        in reducing CVD risk among individuals with diabetes and at increased risk
        for diabetes in western Kenya. We further hypothesize that changes in social
        network characteristics may mediate the impact of these interventions, and
        that baseline social network characteristics may moderate the impact. Aim
        1 is to identify contextual factors, facilitators, and barriers that may impact
        integration of group medical visits and microfinance groups in this setting,
        using novel qualitative research techniques. We will then design a contextually
        and culturally appropriate integrated group medical visit-microfinance model
        for CVD risk reduction. Aim 2 is to evaluate the effectiveness of group medical
        visits and microfinance groups for CVD risk reduction among individuals with
        diabetes or at increased risk of diabetes, by conducting a four-arm cluster
        randomized trial comparing: 1) usual clinical care; 2) usual clinical care
        plus microfinance groups only; 3) group medical visits only; and 4) group
        medical visits integrated into microfinance groups. The primary outcome will
        be one-year change in systolic BP, and a key secondary outcome will be change
        in QRISK2 CVD risk score. We will also conduct mediation analysis and moderation
        analysis to evaluate the influence of social network characteristics on intervention
        outcomes. Aim 3 is to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of each
        intervention arm of the trial. The research will be accomplished by an Early
        Stage Principal Investigator with extensive experience in implementation research
        in low-resource settings, supported by a transdisciplinary team of investigators
        with diverse and complementary expertise. Our goal is to add to the existing
        knowledge base of innovative, scalable, and sustainable strategies to reduce
        CVD risk in diabetes and other chronic diseases in low-resource settings worldwide.\",\"project_title\":\"Bridging

        surgery is advocated for most children with hypospadias to prevent potentially
        serious cosmetic\\nand functional problems. Parents faced with a decision
        about hypospadias repair encounter an irreversible\\nchoice with potentially
        lifelong consequences. Recent studies have identified decisional conflict
        (DC) and\\ndecisional regret (DR) as a significant problem for parents. Several
        recent guidelines on complex urologic\\ntopics suggest that shared decision-making
        (SDM) is the optimal approach. Therefore, I propose to improve\\nSDM and the
        care of hypospadias patients by developing an evidence-based decision aid
        (DA). My\\nhypothesis is that a DA developed for use with parents of hypospadias
        patients will facilitate the SDM process\\nthereby decreasing DC and DR. Furthermore,
        studies assessing DR suggest that family variables, rather than\\nsurgical
        variables, are most strongly associated with DR after hypospadias surgery.
        As such, it is imperative\\nthat we shift our assessment from surgeon- to
        patient-centered outcomes to improve patient/parent\\nsatisfaction. Therefore,
        I also propose to identify patient-centered outcome measures, which emphasize
        what\\nis important to patients with hypospadias as they mature and their
        parents. This study aims to (1) Utilize\\npatient-centered design research
        methods to explore the parental decision making-process regarding\\nhypospadias
        repair and outcomes of importance to parents; (2) Assess qualitatively providers'
        attitudes about\\nSDM and use of a DA for hypospadias; (3) Create a DA and
        postoperative outcome measurement tool for use\\nby parents; and (4) Conduct
        a pilot test of the DA in the clinical setting and a psychometric assessment
        of the\\npatient-centered postoperative outcomes measurement tool. My long-term
        career/research goal is to become\\nan independent investigator with the skills
        to help parents make more informed decisions about hypospadias\\nsurgery and
        objectively measure its long-term outcomes from a patient/parental perspective.
        Additionally I plan\\nto apply this methodology to other urologic genital
        procedures. I hope to develop a fuller understanding of how\\nwe can effectively
        provide parents with optimal decision support and assess our postoperative
        outcomes using\\na parent-centered approach. My career development aims addressed
        in this proposal include (a) Developing\\nproficiency in qualitative research,
        including patient-centered design research methods, (b) Improving delivery\\nof
        pediatric urology services through the development and use of decision support
        tools and patient/parent-\\ncentered outcomes research, and (c) Understanding
        the ethical implications of SDM research. I will complete\\nthis work under
        the mentorship of Dr. Aaron Carroll and a multidisciplinary team with expertise
        in health\\ndecision sciences, pediatric urology and qualitative research.
        Future plans include a multi-site randomized\\ncontrolled trial of the effects
        of DA on hypospadias decision-making and a psychometric assessment of the\\nOMT

        SUMMARY\\nOptical coherence tomography (OCT) is uniquely able to achieve micron
        depth resolution while imaging a large\\n3-dimensional (3D) volume. This enables
        3D imaging and precise measurements in the anterior segment of\\nthe eye,
        including the cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, anterior chamber, iris, and crystalline
        lens. Anterior segment\\nOCT is already widely used in ophthalmology. But
        a number of high-impact applications were held back by\\nlimited speed, range,
        penetration, and disease-specific algorithms. Therefore the specific aims
        are to:\\n (1) Develop ultrahigh performance OCT for anterior eye. A novel
        vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser\\n(VCSEL) will be used to develop an
        OCT prototype with ultrahigh-speed, wide-field, long-range, and high-\\npenetration.
        The high speed and penetration will allow blood vessel imaging (angiography)
        in iris tumors. The\\nwide field and long range will enable accurate whole
        anterior-segment biometry from the apex of the cornea to\\nthe posterior surface
        of the crystalline lens, which will take intraocular lens (IOL) formulas and
        custom scleral\\ncontact lens design to a new level of accuracy.\\n (2) Develop
        OCT angiography (OCTA) of iris tumors. Distinguishing between benign and malignant\\ntumors,
        including deadly melanomas, is crucial for planning treatments that minimize
        damage to sensitive eye\\ntissues and reduce the risk of metastasis. Increased
        vascularity marks malignant transformation in tumors. The\\nproposed ultrahigh
        performance OCT prototype will enable OCTA in tumors with sufficient penetration
        to\\ncharacterize both tumor vasculature and volume. Novel software algorithms
        will be used to suppress motion,\\nprojection, and shadow artifacts, segment
        tissue boundaries, and calculate quantitative vascular density and\\ntortuosity
        measurements. The technology could be useful in the evaluation of tumor angiogenesis
        elsewhere.\\n (3) Improve OCT-based IOL power formula. Previously we developed
        an OCT-based IOL formula that\\nimproved cataract surgery refractive outcome
        in post-myopic LASIK eyes. We now propose to further improve\\nthe OCT-based
        IOL formula so that it could improve refractive outcome in all cataract surgeries,
        and be used\\nto select toric as well non-toric IOL. The long-range OCT can
        accurately measure the crystalline lens equatorial\\nposition to improve the
        prediction of IOL position, which is a crucial variable that currently limits
        the accuracy of\\nIOL formulas. High-speed OCT together with ray-tracing will
        enable more accurate net corneal power and\\nastigmatism measurements, especially
        in post-radial keratotomy and post-hyperopic LASIK eyes.\\n (4) Improve scleral
        lens fitting with wide-field OCT. Scleral contact lens vaults over the cornea
        and\\noffers an important nonsurgical option to restore comfort and vision
        to patients with irregular corneal shape or\\nocular surface inflammation.
        The primary limitation of scleral lens is the difficult trial-and-error fitting
        process.\\nWe will use wide-field OCT corneoscleral topography to improve
        the selection of the initial trial lens and design\\nadvanced radially asymmetric
        scleral lenses that are highly customized to the subject ocular surface.\",\"project_title\":\"Applications

        SUMMARY\\nOvarian cancer is a rare disease that causes tremendous suffering
        because it spreads insidiously along the\\nintestines and strangulates the
        bowel in a cement-like substance that blocks normal functioning. Virtually
        all\\novarian cancer patients develop peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), a severe
        condition that causes bowel\\nobstructions and buildup of fluid in the abdomen
        and lungs. Patients live a median of 3-13 months, but undergo\\nfrequent emergency
        department visits, hospitalizations, and surgical procedures. Over one-third
        are re-\\nadmitted within 30 days of discharge, and 70% are hospitalized near
        death. As the disease advances, patients\\naccumulate tubes, lines, and drains
        – necessitating in-home care by informal caregivers or the patients\\nthemselves.
        2,5-8 A palliative care intervention is desperately needed to improve patients'
        quality of life (QOL),\\nreduce caregivers' distress, and prevent burdensome
        hospital-based care at the end-of-life (EOL).\\nDespite frequent and distressing
        hospitalizations, there is little research testing palliative care\\ninterventions
        in advanced cancer patients with PC who are undergoing transitions in care.
        The long-\\nterm goal of this proposal is to test an effective and scalable
        palliative care intervention to improve the QOL of\\npatients with ovarian
        cancer during care transitions, decrease patient and caregiver distress, and
        – by\\nimproving symptom monitoring and skills training for in-home care –
        reduce burdensome hospital-based care.\\nInformed by Wagner's Chronic Care
        Model36-38 and the ADAPT-ITT framework for intervention adaptation,39 we\\ndeveloped
        BOLSTER (Building Out Lifelines for Safety, Trust, Empowerment, and Renewal),
        a nurse-led care\\nmanagement intervention that harnesses a novel technology
        platform to promote patient and caregiver\\nactivation, self-management, and
        support. BOLSTER combines 1) a longitudinal relationship among a nurse,\\nthe
        patient, and her informal caregiver, with structured contacts between office
        visits; 2) a smartphone-based\\nplatform to assess patient symptoms and/or
        problems managing medical equipment, facilitate self-\\nmanagement, and trigger
        clinical action between visits; and 3) tailored patient and caregiver symptom\\nmanagement
        and skills training. We will refine BOLSTER using a phased approach with patients,
        caregivers,\\nand topical/community experts (Aim 1). We will then assess the
        feasibility and acceptability of BOLSTER\\nthrough a pilot randomized controlled
        trial (RCT) of BOLSTER, and estimate outcome parameters (Aim 2) for a\\nfull-scale
        RCT to test the effectiveness of BOLSTER using an adaptive study design.\\nThis
        project is responsive to PA-18-167 “Palliative Care Needs of Individuals with
        Rare Cancers and Their\\nFamily Caregivers.” Although ovarian cancer is a
        rare disease, BOLSTER has the potential for high impact\\nbecause it targets
        PC, a condition that afflicts approximately 10-15% of all cancer patients
        worldwide.\\nBOLSTER is innovative in targeting a severely distressed and
        neglected population during transitions in care\\nand harnessing smartphones
        to identify and address symptoms before they escalate.\",\"project_title\":\"Strengthening

        science (John Fortney PhD),\\nsecondary CV disease prevention (Dan Forman
        MD), and econometric analysis (Todd Wagner PhD).\\n The proposed research
        seeks to catalyze implementation of home-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR)\\nprograms
        for secondary prevention of IHD. CR programs are multi-disciplinary interventions,
        involving exercise\\ntraining, risk factor management, patient education,
        and counseling, that reduce morbidity and mortality in\\npatients with IHD.
        Despite its compelling benefits and the widespread recommendations for its
        use, less than\\n20% of eligible Medicare patients, and only 10% of Veterans,
        receive CR. Because virtually all CR programs\\nrequire attendance at 12 or
        more in person sessions, the largest barriers to patient participation are
        logistical.\\n The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has begun to address
        this quality gap by developing a small\\nnumber of home-based CR programs.
        Importantly, meta-analyses have demonstrated that home-based and\\nfacility-based
        programs have similar benefits on quality of life, clinical events, and mortality.
        During the past 4\\nyears, 20 (of 124) VA facilities have successfully developed
        and implemented new home-based CR programs\\nmodeled on the AHA “Active Partnership
        for the Health of your Heart” manual. Between 2011 and 2015,\\nparticipation
        in CR among eligible patients more than doubled (from 10% to >25%) at VA facilities
        that\\ndeveloped home-based CR programs, but stayed flat (10%) at VA facilities
        that did not offer home-based CR.\\nHowever, there was marked variation in
        participation rates (ranging from 3% to 43%) across home-based CR\\nsites,
        and the reasons for these differences are unknown.\\n The proposed research
        will address three specific aims: (Aim 1) Determine the key factors of home-\\nbased
        CR programs associated with higher participation rates; (Aim 2) Identify barriers
        to adopting the best\\npractices identified in Aim 1, and develop a home-based

        Conduct a pilot study to evaluate the effect of implementing this tailored
        home-\\nbased CR program (vs. usual care) on rates of CR participation and
        retention in patients with IHD. The\\nactivities performed under this award

        intervention (ACS/PCI). Adherence to antiplatelet medications is critical
        to prevent life-\\nthreatening complications (i.e., stent thrombosis); yet
        rates of non-adherence range from 21-57% by 12\\nmonths. Mobile technology
        through TM or mobile apps is a practical and inexpensive strategy to promote\\nbehavior
        change and enhance medication adherence. The three specific aims of this proposal
        are to: 1)\\ndetermine preferences for content and frequency of TM to promote
        medication adherence through focus\\ngroups; 2) determine the most patient-centered
        app to promote adherence through a content analysis of\\nall commercially
        available apps for medication adherence and focus groups centered on usability;
        and 3)\\ncompare adherence to antiplatelet medications in 225 Veterans post
        ACS/PCI through a randomized\\nclinical trial. Participants will be randomized
        to either TM, mobile app, or website-control group. The\\nfocus groups will
        be stratified by low/high mobile phone use and sex.\\nIn addition, the proposed
        work will provide Dr. Park with the mentorship and experience necessary to\\nestablish
        herself as an early career investigator in the fields of cardiovascular disease
        prevention and\\nmobile health research. Dr. Park's primary career goal is
        to become an independent nurse investigator\\nwho applies novel technology
        for patient-centered behavioral interventions to improve clinical outcomes\\nand
        quality of life for cardiac patients and Veterans. Dr. Park has assembled
        an outstanding\\ninterdisciplinary team of mentors with expertise in the required
        areas of training. Eileen Collins, PhD, RN\\nwill serve as Primary Nurse Mentor;
        Mary Whooley, MD will serve as VA On-Site Mentor; and Janet\\nShim, PhD will
        serve as Qualitative Research Mentor. In addition, John Boscardin, PhD will
        conduct all\\nquantitative statistical analyses related to the study. Consultants
        include Yoshimi Fukuoka, RN, PhD\\n(expert in mobile health strategies) and
        Dr. Michael Ho (expert in medication adherence and\\ncardiovascular disease).
        Susan Woods, MD, MPH (Director of Patient Experience, Connected Health,\\nOffice
        of Information and Analytics, VHA) will serve as a collaborator, particularly
        in relationship to our\\nuse of “Annie,” the new VA automated TM program with
        a goal to help patients take a more active role in\\ntheir health.\\nThe Nursing
        Research Initiative will provide Dr. Park with an exceptional opportunity
        to receive the\\nmentorship and experience necessary to prepare a strong scientific
        foundation for a compelling\\nInvestigator Initiated Research proposal to
        evaluate clinical outcomes (i.e., cardiac morbidity and\\nmortality) through
        a multi-site full scale RCT. Determining the efficacy of mobile technology
        through a\\nVeteran-designed protocol to promote medication adherence will
        have a significant impact on Veteran\\nhealth and public health, particularly

        SUMMARY\\nOver the past two decades, there has been substantial growth in
        opioid consumption during pregnancy,\\ndiagnoses of opioid use disorder among
        pregnant women, and neonatal complications from in utero opioid\\nexposure.
        Untreated opioid use disorder among pregnant women leads to poor outcomes
        for the mother and\\ninfant; however, opioid agonist treatment (OAT) for opioid
        use disorder is highly effective. OAT improves\\ntreatment retention, reduces
        relapse risk, reduces HIV-risk, reduces criminal behavior, reduces risk of\\noverdose
        death, and improves birth weights. Further, ensuring access to OAT before
        pregnancy decreases the\\nlikelihood of illicit drug use during critical times
        of fetal development in the first trimester. Despite evidence that\\ntreatment
        is effective in mitigating adverse outcomes from opioid use disorder, evidence
        suggests that the vast\\nmajority of patients in need of treatment do not
        receive it. We will conduct a rigorous and reproducible field\\nexperiment
        of randomly-selected outpatient buprenorphine providers and opioid treatment
        programs in 10\\nstates with a range of state policies. The study will include
        simulated female patients of reproductive age with\\nrandomly-selected characteristics,
        including pregnancy status. We aim to determine whether: 1a) pregnant\\nwomen
        with opioid use disorder are more likely to experience difficulty accessing
        OAT when compared with\\nnon-pregnant women, 1b) insurance type modifies ability
        to access OAT, and 2) state policies promote or\\nhinder access to treatment.
        The proposed study uses a rich array of methodologies and leverages an\\nexperienced
        research team with expertise in qualitative research, health law, addiction
        medicine, biostatistics,\\nhealth policy, health services research, and economics.
        Results from this work will have immediate applicability\\nto state policymakers

        Summary: The intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB, e.g., soda/pop, sweet
        tea, sports and\\nenergy drinks, fruit drinks) is disproportionately high
        in Appalachia, including among adolescents whose intake\\nis more than double
        the national average and more than four times the recommended daily amount.
        There are\\nstrong and consistent scientific data and systematic reviews documenting
        relationships among high SSB\\nconsumption and numerous chronic health conditions
        such obesity, some types of obesity-related cancers,\\ndiabetes, cardiovascular
        disease, and dental erosion and decay. Reaching adolescents with behaviorally-\\nfocused
        health programs where they spend the majority of their time, at school, shows
        promise. However,\\nengaging caregivers who serve as their child’s most influential
        role model as well as the gatekeeper for the\\nhome environment may be equally
        as important in changing adolescents’ SSB behaviors. Finally, there is a\\ngreat
        need to understand how to support schools and teachers to deliver and maintain
        evidence-based health\\neducation programs, especially among rural schools.
        Thus, the overarching goal of this proposal is to work in\\npartnership with
        Appalachian middle schools to implement and evaluate Kids SIPsmartER. Kids
        SIPsmartER is\\na 6-month, school-based, behavior and health literacy curriculum
        aimed at improving SSB behaviors among\\nmiddle school students. The program
        also integrates a two-way short service message (SMS) strategy to\\nengage
        caregivers in SSB role modeling and supporting home SSB environment changes.
        Kids SIPsmartER is\\ngrounded by the Theory of Planned Behavior as well as
        health literacy, media literacy, numeracy, and public\\nhealth literacy concepts.
        In our proposed cluster-randomized controlled trial, we target 12 middle schools
        in\\nmedically underserved Appalachian counties in southwest Virginia. Our
        study is guided by the RE-AIM (reach,\\nadoption, effectiveness, implementation,
        and maintenance) framework and is a type 1 hybrid design. The\\nprimary aim
        is to assess changes in SSB behaviors at 7-months among 7th grade students
        at schools receiving\\nKids SIPsmartER, as compared to control schools. We
        will also evaluate changes in secondary student\\noutcomes (e.g., BMI, quality
        of life, theory-related variables), changes in caregiver outcomes (e.g., SSB\\nbehaviors,
        home SSB environment), and 19-month maintenance of outcomes. The reach and\\nrepresentativeness
        of Kids SIPsmartER will be assessed. Furthermore, we will use a mixed-methods
        approach\\nwith interviews, surveys, observation, and process evaluation strategies
        to determine the degree to which\\nteachers implement Kids SIPsmartER as intended
        and the potential for institutionalization within the schools.\\nThe long-term
        goal of this health promotion and prevention line of research is to establish
        an effective,\\nscalable, and sustainable multi-level strategy to improve
        SSB behaviors and reduce SSB-related health\\ninequities and chronic conditions
        (e.g. obesity, cancer, type II diabetes, heart disease, dental caries) in

        SUMMARY\\nFor the growing population of adolescents and young adults (AYAs;
        12-24 years) with pediatric heart disease,\\nsurvival comes at a cost due
        to increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Approximately 14,000 children\\nexperience
        heart-failure related hospitalizations annually. Among this group, 7% die
        during their hospitalization\\n– a mortality rate nearly 20 times greater
        than hat seen in hospitalized children without heart failure and more\\nthan
        double that in adult heart failure. The Institute of Medicine recently highlighted
        a critical need to better\\nunderstand and improve medical decision making
        involvement of AYAs afflicted with serious illnesses across\\ntheir disease
        trajectory and as they approach end of life. Yet, research on the end of life
        and palliative care\\nneeds of the growing AYA heart failure population is
        very limited, despite alarmingly high rates of invasive and\\ncostly interventions
        at the end of life for this group. The current proposal seeks to address gaps
        in research\\nand practice through three specific aims via two separate studies:
        Aim 1) To ascertain the end of life care\\nneeds and preferences of pediatric
        heart failure patients and parents via qualitative descriptive research.\\nQuantitative
        measures of disease severity, health-related quality of life, and trust in
        physician will be used to\\nfurther describe the sample. Aim 2) To describe
        provider communication of prognosis, hope, and advance care\\nplanning (e.g.,
        Do Not Resuscitate, Hospice) topics through audio-recorded conversations with
        AYA cardiology\\npatients and/or their families. A priori hypotheses will
        not be tested for Aims 1 and 2 given their qualitative\\nnature. Themes will
        be determined for future hypothesis-driven research. Aim 3) To develop and
        pilot a\\nprovider-directed end of life care communication intervention. It
        is hypothesized that intervention participation\\nwill lead to increased provider
        use of rapport and partnership building statements and greater physician\\ncommunication
        of prognosis, hope, and advance care planning topics. In addition to these
        three research aims,\\nthe K23 proposal includes a robust four-year research
        training plan. With the support of an interdisciplinary\\nteam of expert mentors
        and advisors, Study PI will gain experiences in qualitative research, pediatric
        palliative\\ncare and bioethics, and randomized intervention trial design
        and statistical analysis. Training goals will be\\naccomplished through didactic
        coursework; mentored studies and frequent interactions with mentors and\\nadvisors;
        and seminars, meetings, conferences and workshops. This K23-supported research
        training and\\nfoundational data will enable Study PI to obtain long-term
        career goals, which include the development and\\nimplementation of an R01-funded

        \  \\nDESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early obesity puts children at
        increased risk for adult obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), early mortality,
        and other risks relative to normal weight children. Most parents of obese
        children are not concerned about their child's weight, and parents grossly
        underestimate the probabilities that their child will be obese and develop
        CVD in adulthood. Parents of obese children who have enrolled in obesity treatment
        programs cite a desire to improve their child's long-term health as a reason
        for engaging in behavior change. Concern about a child's health may be an
        important facilitator for behavior change engagement. Therefore, we are interested
        in understanding ways to promote accurate understanding of children's long-term
        health risks in order to raise an appropriate level of concern about obese
        children's weight and increase uptake of healthful behaviors. Health care
        providers are essential to help parents understand whether their child is
        on a healthy weight trajectory, but providers do not have effective tools
        for talking to parents about obesity and its associated adverse health risks;
        BMI growth charts alone are insufficient. This proposal's overall research
        goal is to identiy clinic-based risk communication approaches that can motivate
        parents of obese children to engage in behavior change to prevent future obesity
        and CVD. In Aim 1, we will develop novel risk communication messages. We will
        consider several novel approaches around message content and framing, but
        primarily, we propose using microsimulation models to forecast a child's long-term
        health risks, based on his age, race, gender, BMI, and family history of CVD.
        Qualitative interviews with providers and parents, and a stakeholder panel
        comprised of health researchers and parent research partners, will be used
        to evaluate potentially effective and acceptable messages. In Aim 2, we will
        experimentally evaluate the efficacy of four novel risk communication messages
        on parental behavior change willingness and intent using a national web-based
        survey. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the acceptability and effectiveness
        of new risk communication messages in a clinical setting, and we will observe
        the impact of new messages on behavior change activities. A survey will assess
        parent-perceived risks, perceived message accuracy, concern about child health,
        and anxiety. This research plan is part of a K01 proposal designed to provide
        scholarly training, mentorship, and support for Dr. Wright to gain skills
        and experience needed to conduct research on how improved obesity-related
        risk communication messages may affect child behavior change. Dr. Wright is
        a decision scientist whose career goal is to become an independent investigator
        with a focus on using decision science methods to motivate uptake of childhood
        obesity treatment and behavior change. To achieve this objective, she will
        pursue training in: (1) the psychology of medical decision making and principles
        of pediatric risk communication, (2) qualitative research methods, and (3)
        the design, implementation, and evaluation of behavioral health interventions.

        Summary/Abstract\\nThe overarching aim of the current application is to support
        the ability of the Mid-Atlantic Node to continue its\\nparticipation in and
        enhance the scientific research mission of the NIDA Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical
        Trials\\nNetwork (CTN) as the mission of the CTN continues to evolve. Our
        leadership of and participation in CTN\\nresearch has been substantial and
        forms the basis for continued contributions. In the most recent funding\\nperiod,
        we participated successfully in three CTN studies (0032, HIV Rapid Testing
        and Counseling; 0044,\\nWeb-Based Treatment of Substance Abusers; 0049, Hospital
        as the Opportunity for Patient Engagement),\\nconducted two ancillary studies
        and enrolled over 600 participants. Currently, we are participating in two\\nstudies
        (0051; 0059) and providing national leadership for CTN 0059, a study to develop
        and validate a\\nsubstance use screening and assessment tool for use in future
        CTN research. Our faculty offers expertise in a\\nwide range of research areas
        including behavioral and pharmacological treatment of substance abuse,\\ntreatment
        of adolescents with substance use disorders, medications development, contingency
        management,\\nscreening, assessment and brief intervention, HIV treatment,
        tobacco smoking treatment, clinical trials\\nmethodology and qualitative research.
        We propose to continue supporting our well-established Node\\ninfrastructure
        that is needed to carry out the CTN research mission and to continue contributing
        the expertise\\nand leadership available within the node. We envision and
        propose an innovative CTN research agenda with\\nhigh public health importance
        that will identify and intervene with substance users found within medical
        care\\nsettings. New research on Screening and Brief Intervention will seek
        to identify subgroups that may benefit\\nfrom this approach. Other proposed
        research will focus on linkage of patients with substance use at levels\\nrequiring
        more intensive intervention to treatment services. Patient Navigation will
        be examined as an\\napproach to facilitating the care transitions across service
        delivery systems and motivating patients to engage\\nin available services.
        This agenda builds on past CTN research and provides a visionary and feasible
        blueprint\\nfor cooperative multi-site research within the CTN and its affiliated
        medical care and drug treatment institutions.\\nWe have long maintained strong
        affiliations with an array of adult and adolescent community substance abuse\\ntreatment
        programs. Recent developments in health care have expanded the focus of our
        community\\ninvolvement increasingly toward medical settings, including those
        with comprehensive care models that deliver\\nboth primary care and behavioral
        health services. We will continue to affiliate and engage a variety of hospital,\\ncommunity
        health and substance abuse treatment agencies that will serve as future resources
        for recruitment\\nand conduct of CTN research. Overall, the Mid-Atlantic Node
        has made substantive contributions to the CTN\\nthat provide the foundation
        for its future involvement, and is well positioned to continue this involvement.\",\"project_title\":\"Clinical

        Summary\\nYoung men who have sex with men (MSM) are at high risk for HIV infection
        in the United States, representing\\n80% of all infections among youth ages
        14-24, and 92% of infections among boys ages 14-19. Despite these\\nrisks,
        the field has not even one HIV prevention intervention shown to be effective
        in decreasing sexual risks or\\nincreasing HIV testing among adolescent MSM
        (AMSM). Historically, reaching AMSM for HIV prevention has\\nbeen challenging,
        given their relative geographic isolation and lack of access to traditional
        gay congregating\\nspaces (e.g., bars and many gay-related social networking
        websites). However, our team has developed a novel\\nonline platform for delivering
        interventions to parents of LGB youth that currently sees thousands of visitors
        each\\nyear. HIV prevention advocates have identified parents of AMSM as an
        untapped resource for reducing HIV risk\\nin this population. Parent-child
        communication about sex has well-demonstrated associations with adolescent\\nrisk
        behaviors, and interventions with parents of heterosexual youth have been
        shown to be effective in\\nincreasing parent-adolescent communication, and
        thereby, reducing adolescent health risks. Thus, the goal of\\nthe proposed
        study is to develop an online intervention to increase and improve parent
        communication with\\nAMSM about sexuality and HIV, with the ultimate goal
        of decreasing adolescent sexual risk and increasing HIV\\ntesting. To achieve
        this goal, we proposed four specific aims: (1) Identify the ways to best educate,
        motivate,\\nand guide parents in communicating about sexuality and HIV with
        their sons by conducting interviews and\\nfocus groups with AMSM and their
        parents, (2) Develop a web-based, multimedia, intervention that motivates\\nand
        teaches parents how to communicate effectively with their sons about HIV-related
        topics, (3) Pilot test the\\nacceptability of the intervention and functionality
        of the system, and (4) Conduct a pilot randomized, controlled\\ntrial of the
        intervention. Aims 1-3 will be achieved by collecting interview and focus
        group data from AMSM and\\ntheir parents, and then collaborating with a team
        of parents and adolescent to synthesize existing data, design\\nthe intervention,
        and test its acceptability and functionality. Aim 4 will be achieved by randomizing
        parents who\\ncome to seek resources on our existing website to receive either
        our new intervention or control, and then\\ngathering longitudinal, online
        data from parents in both study arms and their AMSM sons over a 2-4 month\\nperiod.
        Importantly, our study team has already demonstrated the feasibility of (a)
        recruiting parent-AMSM\\ndyads into qualitative research, and (b) utilizing
        our website to enroll parent-AMSM dyads into longitudinal\\nquantitative research.
        Thus, our proposal is innovative in that it uses our existing, proven resources
        to address\\nmany of the barriers that have historically plagued research
        on AMSM and their parents, as well as efforts to\\nintervene with this population.
        If found to be effective, this would be the first ever HIV prevention intervention\\nshown
        to work for AMSM – the population of adolescents who are at highest risk for
        HIV infection.\",\"project_title\":\"Developing an HIV prevention intervention

        SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT\\n Candidate. I am a psychology post-doctoral research and
        clinical fellow with the Massachusetts General\\nHospital Cardiac Psychiatry
        Research Program. I hold a PhD in clinical health psychology and a master
        of\\nhealth science (MHS) degree in epidemiology. I have first- or co-authored
        26 peer-reviewed publications\\nfocusing on individual, group, and community-based
        strategies for physical activity and nutrition promotion,\\nobesity and chronic
        disease prevention, and the intersection of mental and physical health. My
        short-term\\ncareer goals are to develop and refine my clinical research skills
        with a focus on physical activity promotion. I\\nplan to develop the skills
        I need to lead a clinical research program by pursuing this K23 award. This
        award\\nwould support my long-term career goals by providing me with the skills
        to become an independent researcher\\nfocused on developing novel interventions
        to promote physical activity for chronic disease prevention. If the\\nproposed
        intervention proves successful, it will provide data to pursue future research
        using this intervention,\\nthereby building the evidence base for patient-oriented
        multilevel physical activity interventions.\\n Career Development. I will
        develop this intervention based on relevant theory, patient input, and expertise\\nfrom
        my mentorship team: Dr. Jeff Huffman (clinical research, positive psychology),
        Dr. Elyse Park (qualitative\\nresearch, motivational interviewing), Dr. Anne
        Thorndike (metabolic syndrome, environmental interventions),\\nand Dr. Brian
        Healy (biostatistics). My team consultants, Dr. I-Min Lee (physical activity,
        measurement) and Dr.\\nLisa Quintilliani (community-based research, dissemination
        and implementation) will provide further expertise\\nto support my training
        goals and research plan. The intervention development, testing, and dissemination\\nprocess,
        along with relevant coursework, seminars, and workshops, will support my four
        training goals: 1)\\ndeveloping analytic skills for qualitative, clinical,
        and multilevel data, 2) becoming an expert in metabolic\\nsyndrome risk and
        prevention, 3) learning cutting-edge and technology-based physical activity
        and sedentary\\nbehavior measurement, and 4) dissemination and implementation
        of research findings.\\n Environment. I will conduct this project at Massachusetts
        General Hospital (MGH), a Harvard Medical\\nSchool teaching hospital, using
        its extensive resources for training and supporting clinical researchers and\\nperforming
        top-quality research. The MGH Cardiac Psychiatry Research Program (CPRP),
        my current\\nresearch group, will be the primary setting for this award. Led
        by my primary mentor, Dr. Huffman, the group\\nhas performed numerous health
        promotion trials in patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The\\nCPRP
        is actively enrolling participants for five trials, including an NHLBI-funded
        R01 treatment development\\ntrial of positive psychology and motivational
        interviewing in cardiac patients. I will recruit patients from two\\nprimary
        care clinics that are actively engaged in research. I will also collaborate
        with the MGH Behavioral\\nMedicine Service, a large research and clinical
        program that aims to develop and validate behavioral\\ninterventions for individuals
        with medical illness. The MGH Clinical Research Program and Harvard Catalyst\\nprograms
        will also support my proposed project with clinical research consulting services,
        seminars and\\ncourses on the responsible conduct of research, IRB preparation,
        and using HIPAA and research-compliant\\nelectronic data capture software.\\n
        Research development and design. The overall aim of this project is to develop
        and test a behavioral\\nintervention to increase physical activity among patients
        with metabolic syndrome (MetS) who are insufficiently\\nactive. MetS affects
        about 34% of US adults and is comprised of five cardio-metabolic risk factors
        that are\\nstrongly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes,
        cardiovascular disease, and related mortality.\\nPhysical activity plays a
        key role in preventing progression from MetS to these diseases, but a majority
        of\\npeople with MetS risk factors do not meet physical activity recommendations.\\n
        The goal of this project is to identify insufficiently active primary care
        patients with MetS risk factors and\\nhelp them increase their physical activity
        by creating a multilevel intervention addressing targets at the\\nindividual,
        social, and environmental levels. This project will develop and test a combined
        positive psychology\\nand motivational interviewing intervention in a group
        setting and have participants complete a neighborhood\\nwalkability assessment.
        I plan to follow the NIH-supported ORBIT model for health behavior change\\nintervention
        development to create the intervention in three phases: 1) qualitative research
        and intervention\\ndevelopment (N=20), 2) a feasibility pilot trial and intervention
        refinement (N=16), and 3) a small randomized\\ncontrolled trial (N=64). The
        specific aims are to sequentially develop the intervention and test its feasibility,\\nacceptability,
        and preliminary clinical impact. The hypotheses are that this intervention
        i) will be feasible and\\nacceptable, and ii) that patients in the intervention
        group will increase their physical activity, positive emotions,\\nand related
        health behaviors, more than an enhanced usual care control group.\\n This
        study’s aims will address important research gaps by systematically, iteratively
        developing a multilevel\\n(individual, social, and environmental) physical
        activity intervention customized for MetS. Each study aim\\naddresses one
        or more of my training goals and allows me to use the breadth of resources
        available at MGH\\nand Harvard to become proficient in leading clinical trials
        that have a public health impact.\",\"project_title\":\"Testing the feasibility
